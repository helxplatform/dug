Symptoms often include tremors, excessive crying, sleep deprivation, and swallowing difficulties. Cases are rising, with a newborn affected by NOWS approximately every 15 minutes. Currently, healthcare providers in the United States lack standard, evidence-based treatments for NOWS.\n\nThis project is part of a multi-center, randomized controlled clinical trial that directly compares NOWS treatmentsmorphine, methadone, and buprenorphineand takes into account other types of non-drug therapies, such as behavioral interventions. The goal is to generate results that can inform clinical practice guidelines and give newborns with NOWS the best start possible.\n\nThis site will serve as the Data Coordinating Center for the clinical trial to provide high-quality and impartial biostatistical expertise for all the study sites.\"",

Researchers will build upon a validated biophysical model of the effects of SCS on sensory signal processing in neurons within the dorsal horn of the spinal cord to better understand how to improve the electrical stimulus patterns applied to the spinal cord. They will use sensitivity analyses to determine the robustness of stimulation patterns to variations in electrode positioning, selectivity of stimulation, and biophysical properties of the dorsal horn neural network. Researchers will demonstrate improvements from these new stimulus patterns by 1) measuring their effects on pain-related behavioral outcomes in a rat model of chronic neuropathic pain and by 2) quantifying the effects of optimized temporal patterns on spinal cord neuron activity. The outcome will be mechanistically derived and validated stimulus patterns that are significantly more efficacious than the phenomenologically derived standard of care patterns; these patterns could be implemented with either a software update or minor hardware modifications to existing SCS products.",

Aim 1: Develop tFUS devices for pain treatment. The mouse-scale system will be designed to validate the therapeutic effect of stimulating the anticipated cortical targets. This will inform development of the simpler human-scale system, which will use models of the skull to select cost-effective transducers to reach the targets. Aim 2: Evaluate tFUS effectiveness and optimize stimulation parameters in an SCD mice model. Researchers will determine effective tFUS parameters to chronically reduce SCD pain in mice and validate this using behavioral measures. Aim 3: Use electrophysiological source imaging to target and trigger closed-loop tFUS in animal models. This aim also includes performing safety studies to prepare for human trials.

NIDA and the FDA have encouraged investigators to expand the range of therapeutic outcomes, beyond measurement of abstinence. Insomnia is a clinically significant, but understudied, correlate/predictor of relapse to substance use. Yet most medications for treating insomnia have limited efficacy and can produce side effects. The orexin (OX) system plays a key role in sleep and substance use, offering a promising avenue for study. This project will address whether OX-1/2 antagonism is a mechanism that can directly improve outpatient opioid abstinence, or whether OX antagonism corrects sleep deficiencies and indirectly improves opioid abstinence. Specific aims are to determine whether nightly treatment with the OX-1/2 antagonist suvorexant, relative to placebo, 1) increases outpatient opioid abstinence and 2) improves sleep efficiency on the residential detoxification unit. The study will also determine 3) whether improved sleep efficiency predicts greater opioid abstinence (regardless of group assignment).",

No diagnostic tool exists to identify patients that will develop CIPNP in response to taxane therapy.

This biomarker signature will be used to detect CIPNP-susceptible patients early and personalize their taxane therapy to minimize CIPNP while optimizing the therapeutic taxane dosing.",
