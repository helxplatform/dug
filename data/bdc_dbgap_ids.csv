Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death and serious illness in the United States. In 1948, the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) -- under the direction of the National Heart Institute (now known as the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, NHLBI) -- embarked on a novel and ambitious project in health research. At the time, little was known about the general causes of heart disease and stroke, but the death rates for CVD had been increasing steadily since the beginning of the century and had become an American epidemic. The objective of the FHS was to identify the common factors or characteristics that contribute to CVD by following its development over a long period of time in a large group of participants who had not yet developed overt symptoms of CVD or suffered a heart attack or stroke. Design of Framingham Heart Study. In 1948, the researchers recruited 5,209 men and women between the ages of 30 and 62 from the town of Framingham, Massachusetts, and began the first round of extensive physical examinations and lifestyle interviews that they would later analyze for common patterns related to CVD development. Since 1948, the subjects have returned to the study every two years for an examination consisting of a detailed medical history, physical examination, and laboratory tests, and in 1971, the study enrolled a second-generation cohort -- 5,124 of the original participants' adult children and their spouses -- to participate in similar examinations. The second examination of the Offspring cohort occurred eight years after the first examination, and subsequent examinations have occurred approximately every four years thereafter. In April 2002 the Study entered a new phase: the enrollment of a third generation of participants, the grandchildren of the original cohort. The first examination of the Third Generation Study was completed in July 2005 and involved 4,095 participants. Thus, the FHS has evolved into a prospective, community-based, three generation family study. The FHS is a joint project of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute and Boston University. Research Areas in the Framingham Heart Study. Over the years, careful monitoring of the FHS population has led to the identification of the major CVD risk factors -- high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, smoking, obesity, diabetes, and physical inactivity -- as well as a great deal of valuable information on the effects of related factors such as blood triglyceride and HDL cholesterol levels, age, gender, and psychosocial issues. Risk factors have been identified for the major components of CVD, including coronary heart disease, stroke, intermittent claudication, and heart failure. It is also clear from research in the FHS and other studies that substantial subclinical vascular disease occurs in the blood vessels, heart and brain that precedes clinical CVD. With recent advances in technology, the FHS has enhanced its research capabilities and capitalized on its inherent resources by the conduct of high resolution imaging to detect and quantify subclinical vascular disease in the major blood vessels, heart and brain. These studies have included ultrasound studies of the heart (echocardiography) and carotid arteries, computed tomography studies of the heart and aorta, and magnetic resonance imaging studies of the brain, heart, and aorta. Although the Framingham cohort is primarily white, the importance of the major CVD risk factors identified in this group have been shown in other studies to apply almost universally among racial and ethnic groups, even though the patterns of distribution may vary from group to group. In the past half century, the Study has produced approximately 1,200 articles in leading medical journals. The concept of CVD risk factors has become an integral part of the modern medical curriculum and has led to the development of effective treatment and preventive strategies in clinical practice. In addition to research studies focused on risk factors, subclinical CVD and clinically apparent CVD, Framingham investigators have also collaborated with leading researchers from around the country and throughout the world on projects involving some of the major chronic illnesses in men and women, including dementia, osteoporosis and arthritis, nutritional deficiencies, eye diseases, hearing disorders, and chronic obstructive lung diseases. Genetic Research in the Framingham Heart Study. While pursuing the Study's established research goals, the NHLBI and the Framingham investigators has expanded its research mission into the study of genetic factors underlying CVD and other disorders. Over the past two decades, DNA has been collected from blood samples and from immortalized cell lines obtained from Original Cohort participants, members of the Offspring Cohort and the Third Generation Cohort. Several large-scale genotyping projects have been conducted in the past decade. Genome-wide linkage analysis has been conducted using genotypes of approximately 400 microsatellite markers that have been completed in over 9,300 subjects in all three generations. Analyses using microsatellite markers completed in the original cohort and offspring cohorts have resulted in over 100 publications, including many publications from the Genetics Analysis Workshop 13. Several other recent collaborative projects have completed thousands of SNP genotypes for candidate gene regions in subsets of FHS subjects with available DNA. These projects include the Cardiogenomics Program of the NHLBI's Programs for Genomics Applications, the genotyping of ~3000 SNPs in inflammation genes, and the completion of a genome-wide scan of 100,000 SNPs using the Affymetrix 100K Genechip. Framingham Cohort Phenotype Data. The phenotype database contains a vast array of phenotype information available in all three generations. These will include the quantitative measures of the major risk factors such as systolic blood pressure, total and HDL cholesterol, fasting glucose, and cigarette use, as well as anthropomorphic measures such as body mass index, biomarkers such as fibrinogen and CRP, and electrocardiography measures such as the QT interval. Many of these measures have been collected repeatedly in the original and offspring cohorts. Also included in the SHARe database will be an array of recently collected biomarkers, subclinical disease imaging measures, clinical CVD outcomes as well as an array of ancillary studies. The phenotype data is located here in the top-level study phs000007 Framingham Cohort.

This project will establish a racially diverse cohort that is sufficiently large and appropriately designed for genome-wide association analysis of COPD. A total of 10,000 subjects will be recruited, including control smokers, definite COPD cases (GOLD Stage 2 to 4), and subjects not included in either group (GOLD 1 or GOLD-Unclassified). This cohort will be used for cross-sectional analysis, although long-term longitudinal follow-up will be a future goal. The primary focus of the study will be genome-wide association analysis to identify the genetic risk factors that determine susceptibility for COPD and COPD-related phenotypes. Detailed phenotyping of both cases and controls, including chest CT scan assessment of emphysema and airway disease, will allow identification of genetic determinants for the heterogeneous components of the COPD syndrome. The hypotheses to be studied are: 1) Precise phenotypic characterization of COPD subjects using computed tomography, as well as clinical and physiological measures, will provide data that will enable the broad COPD syndrome to be decomposed into clinically significant subtypes. 2) Genome-wide association studies will identify genetic determinants for COPD susceptibility that will provide insight into clinically relevant COPD subtypes. 3) Distinct genetic determinants influence the development of emphysema and airway disease. The initial phase of genome-wide association analysis included 500 COPD cases and 500 control subjects (all non-Hispanic White) genotyped with the Illumina Omni-1 chip. The second phase genotyped the entire study cohort using the Illumina Omni-Express chip.

The original WHI study included 161,808 postmenopausal women enrolled between 1993 and 1998. The Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, WA serves as the WHI Clinical Coordinating Center for data collection, management, and analysis of the WHI. The WHI has two major parts: a partial factorial randomized Clinical Trial (CT) and an Observational Study (OS); both were conducted at 40 Clinical Centers nationwide. The CT enrolled 68,132 postmenopausal women between the ages of 50-79 into trials testing three prevention strategies. If eligible, women could choose to enroll in one, two, or all three of the trial components. The components are:  Hormone Therapy Trials (HT): This double-blind component examined the effects of combined hormones or estrogen alone on the prevention of coronary heart disease and osteoporotic fractures, and associated risk for breast cancer. Women participating in this component with an intact uterus were randomized to estrogen plus progestin (conjugated equine estrogens [CEE], 0.625 mg/d plus medroxyprogesterone acetate [MPA] 2.5 mg/d] or a matching placebo. Women with prior hysterectomy were randomized to CEE or placebo. Both trials were stopped early, in July 2002 and March 2004, respectively, based on adverse effects. All HT participants continued to be followed without intervention until close-out. Dietary Modification Trial (DM): The Dietary Modification component evaluated the effect of a low-fat and high fruit, vegetable and grain diet on the prevention of breast and colorectal cancers and coronary heart disease. Study participants were randomized to either their usual eating pattern or a low-fat dietary pattern. Calcium/Vitamin D Trial (CaD): This double-blind component began 1 to 2 years after a woman joined one or both of the other clinical trial components. It evaluated the effect of calcium and vitamin D supplementation on the prevention of osteoporotic fractures and colorectal cancer. Women in this component were randomized to calcium (1000 mg/d) and vitamin D (400 IU/d) supplements or a matching placebo.   The Observational Study (OS) examines the relationship between lifestyle, environmental, medical and molecular risk factors and specific measures of health or disease outcomes. This component involves tracking the medical history and health habits of 93,676 women not participating in the CT. Recruitment for the observational study was completed in 1998 and participants were followed annually for 8 to 12 years. Extension Studies: The original protocol allowed for follow-up until March 2005, after which participants were invited to enroll in the first WHI Extension Study for follow-up through 2010. Participants were invited again to participate in the second WHI Extension Study with continued follow up from 2010 to at least 2015. As of March 31, 2011 there were 93,122 women enrolled in the second extension. In Extension Study 2, the overall WHI study population was divided into two new subsamples, the Medical Records Cohort (MRC) and the Self-Report Cohort (SRC). The MRC consists of all former hormone trial participants and all African American and Hispanic participants from all study components. The SRC consists of the remaining participants. The extent of outcome information collected differs between the two cohorts, with more extensive outcomes information collection on the MRC. As part of Extension Study 2, selected older WHI participants were invited to participate in an In Person Visit (a.k.a., Long Life Study) at their homes during which additional blood samples were collected and various measurements were taken (such as blood pressure, height, weight, waist circumference, grip strength, etc.). In October 2015, Extension Study 2 was renewed with continued follow-up planned through October 2020, pending annual contract review and renewal.

phs000209.v13.p3,c1,Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) Cohort,parent,2024-05-09,"Name: MESA_HMB_, short name: MESA.","MESA The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) is a study of the characteristics of subclinical cardiovascular disease (disease detected non-invasively before it has produced clinical signs and symptoms) and the risk factors that predict progression to clinically overt cardiovascular disease or progression of the subclinical disease. MESA researchers study a diverse, population-based sample of 6,814 asymptomatic men and women aged 45-84. Thirty-eight percent of the recruited participants are white, 28 percent African-American, 22 percent Hispanic, and 12 percent Asian, predominantly of Chinese descent. Participants were recruited from six field centers across the United States: Wake Forest University, Columbia University, Johns Hopkins University, University of Minnesota, Northwestern University and University of California - Los Angeles. Each participant received an extensive physical exam and determination of coronary calcification, ventricular mass and function, flow-mediated endothelial vasodilation, carotid intimal-medial wall thickness and presence of echogenic lucencies in the carotid artery, lower extremity vascular insufficiency, arterial wave forms, electrocardiographic (ECG) measures, standard coronary risk factors, sociodemographic factors, lifestyle factors, and psychosocial factors. Selected repetition of subclinical disease measures and risk factors at follow-up visits allows study of the progression of disease. Blood samples have been assayed for putative biochemical risk factors and stored for case-control studies. DNA has been extracted and lymphocytes cryopreserved (for possible immortalization) for study of candidate genes and possibly, genome-wide scanning, expression, and other genetic techniques. Participants are being followed for identification and characterization of cardiovascular disease events, including acute myocardial infarction and other forms of coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, and congestive heart failure; for cardiovascular disease interventions; and for mortality. In addition to the six Field Centers, MESA involves a Coordinating Center, a Central Laboratory, and Central Reading Centers for Computed Tomography (CT), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Ultrasound, and Electrocardiography (ECG). Protocol development, staff training, and pilot testing were performed in the first 18 months of the study. The first examination took place over two years, from July 2000 - July 2002. It was followed by four examination periods that were 17-20 months in length. Participants have been contacted every 9 to 12 months throughout the study to assess clinical morbidity and mortality. MESA Family The general goal of the MESA Family Study, an ancillary study to MESA funded by a grant from NHLBI, is to apply modern genetic analysis and genotyping methodologies to delineate the genetic determinants of early atherosclerosis. This is being accomplished by utilizing all the current organizational structures of the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) and Genetic Centers at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and University of Virginia. In the MESA Family Study, the goal is to locate and identify genes contributing to the genetic risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD), by looking at the early changes of atherosclerosis within families (mainly siblings). 2128 individuals from 594 families, yielding 3,026 sibpairs divided between African Americans and Hispanic-Americans, were recruited by utilizing the existing framework of MESA. MESA Family studied siblings of index subjects from the MESA study and from new sibpair families (with the same demographic characteristics) and is determining the extent of genetic contribution to the variation in coronary calcium (obtained via CT Scan) and carotid artery wall thickness (B-mode ultrasound) in the two largest non-majority U.S. populations. In a small proportion of subjects, parents of MESA index subjects participating in MESA Family were studied but only to have blood drawn for genotyping. The MESA Family cohort was recruited from the six MESA Field Centers. MESA Family participants underwent the same examination as MESA participants during May 2004 - May 2007. DNA was extracted and lymphocytes immortalized for study of candidate genes, genome-wide linkage scanning, and analyzed for linkage with these subclinical cardiovascular traits. While linkage analysis is the primary approach being used, an additional aspect of the MESA Family Study takes advantage of the existing MESA study population for testing a variety of candidate genes for association with the same subclinical traits. Genotyping and data analysis will occur throughout the study. MESA Air The general goal of the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis and Air Pollution ('MESA Air') is to prospectively examine the relation between an individual level assessment of long-term ambient air pollution exposures (including PM2.5 and the progression of subclinical cardiovascular disease in a multi-city, multi-ethnic cohort. MESA Air will also prospectively examine the relationship between an individual level assessment of long-term ambient air pollution exposures and the incidence of cardiovascular disease, including myocardial infarction and cardiovascular death. MESA AIR is funded by a grant from the United States Environmental Protection Agency to the University of Washington and subcontracts from the UW to other participating institutions. MESA Air will assess if ambient air pollution is associated with changes over time in subclinical measures of atherosclerosis and plasma markers of inflammation, oxidative damage, and endothelial activation in a longitudinal data model, adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and specific cardiovascular risk factors (such as diabetes, hypertension, smoking, and diet). The study will similarly assess if the incidence of cardiovascular events is associated with long-term exposure to ambient air pollution, using a proportional hazards model. The study includes refinement of statistical tools, and explores joint/independent effects of acute and long-term pollutant exposure in the occurrence of cardiovascular disease. The MESA Air study is built on the foundation of the ongoing MESA study. The parent MESA Study cohort is located in six geographic areas ('Field Centers') that capture tremendous exposure heterogeneity, comparable to or greater than the variability in locations of prior U.S. cohort studies. In addition to the six Field Centers, the study involves a Coordinating Center, a Central Laboratory, and Reading Centers for Computed Tomography (CT), ultrasound and air pollution data. The cohort for the MESA Air study currently includes 6226 subjects: 5479 enrolled in the parent MESA study; 257 recruited specifically for this study, and 490 recruited from the MESA Family study. The entire MESA Air cohort will be followed over a 10-year project period for the occurrence of cardiovascular disease events. On two occasions over the ten-year study period, 3600 subjects from the MESA Air cohort, residing in nine locales, will undergo computed tomography scanning to assess presence and extent of coronary artery calcification (CAC), and ultrasound of the carotid artery to determine intima-media thickness (IMT). We will also repeatedly assess plasma markers of inflammation, oxidative damage, and endothelial function in 720 subjects. MESA Air adds state-of-the-art air pollution exposure assessment information to the MESA cohort study, and introduces new subjects and outcome measures to achieve our aims. The study will assess long-term individual-level exposure to ambient air pollutants for each subject using community-scale monitoring, outdoor spatial variation, subject proximity to pollution sources, pollutants' infiltration efficiency, and personal time-activity information. The exposure models will be validated using detailed monitoring in a subset of subjects. The MESA Cohort is utilized in the following dbGaP substudies.

phs000284.v2.p1,c1,NHLBI Cleveland Family Study (CFS) Candidate Gene Association Resource (CARe),parent,2024-05-09,"Name: CFS_DS-HLBS-IRB-NPU_, short name: CFS.","The Cleveland Family Study is the largest family-based study of sleep apnea world-wide, consisting of 2284 individuals (46% African American) from 361 families studied on up to 4 occasions over a period of 16 years. The study was begun in 1990 with the initial aims of quantifying the familial aggregation of sleep apnea. NIH renewals provided expansion of the original cohort (including increased minority recruitment) and longitudinal follow-up, with the last exam occurring in February 2006. Index probands (n=275) were recruited from 3 area hospital sleep labs if they had a confirmed diagnosis of sleep apnea and at least 2 first-degree relatives available to be studied. In the first 5 years of the study, neighborhood control probands (n=87) with at least 2 living relatives available for study were selected at random from a list provided by the index family and also studied. All available first degree relatives and spouses of the case and control probands also were recruited. Second-degree relatives, including half-sibs, aunts, uncles and grandparents, were also included if they lived near the first degree relatives (cases or controls), or if the family had been found to have two or more relatives with sleep apnea. Blood was sampled and DNA isolated for participants seen in the last two exam cycles (n=1447). The sample, which is enriched with individuals with sleep apnea, also contains a high prevalence of individuals with sleep apnea-related traits, including: obesity, impaired glucose tolerance, and HTN. Phenotyping data have been collected over 4 exam cycles, each occurring ~every 4 years. The last three exams targeted all subjects who had been studied at earlier exams, as well as new minority families and family members of previously studied probands who had been unavailable at prior exams. Data from one, two, three and four visits are available for 412, 630, 329 and 67, participants, respectively. In the first 3 exams, participants underwent overnight in-home sleep studies, allowing determination of the number and duration of hypopneas and apneas, sleep period, heart rate, and oxygen saturation levels; anthropometry (weight, height, and waist, hip, and neck circumferences); resting blood pressure; spirometry; standardized questionnaire evaluation of symptoms, medications, sleep patterns, quality of life, daytime sleepiness measures and health history; venipuncture and measurement of total and HDL cholesterol. The 4th exam (2001-2006) was designed to collect more detailed measurements of sleep, metabolic and CVD phenotypes and included measurement of state-of-the-art polysomnography, with both collection of blood and measurement of blood pressure before and after sleep, and anthropometry, upper airway assessments, spirometry, exhaled nitric oxide, and ECG performed the morning after the sleep study. Data have been collected by trained research assistants or GCRC nurses following written Manuals of Procedures who were certified following standard approaches for each study procedure. Ongoing data quality, with assessment of within or between individual drift, has been monitored on an ongoing basis, using statistical techniques as well as regular re-certification procedures. Between and within scorer reliabilities for key sleep apnea indices have been excellent, with intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) exceeding 0.92 for the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI). Sleep staging, assessed with epoch specific comparisons, also demonstrate excellent reliability for stage identification (kappas>0.82). There has been no evidence of significant time trends-between or within scorers- for the AHI variables. We also have evaluated the night-to-night variability of the AHI and other sleep variables in 91 subjects, with each measurement made 1-3 months apart. There is high night to night consistency for the AHI (ICC: 0.80), the arousal index (0.76), and the % sleep time in slow-wave sleep (0.73). We have demonstrated the comparability of the apnea estimates (AHI) determined from limited channel studies obtained at in-home settings with in full in-laboratory polysomnography. In addition to our published validation study, we more recently compared the AHI in 169 Cleveland Family Study participants undergoing both assessments (in-home and in-laboratory) within one week apart. These showed excellent levels of agreement (ICC=0.83), demonstrating the feasibility of examining data from either in-home or in-laboratory studies for apnea phenotyping. Data collected in the GCRC were obtained, when possible, with comparable, if not identical techniques, as were the same measures collected at prior exams performed in the participants' homes. To address the comparability of data collected over different exams, we calculated the crude age-adjusted correlations ~3 year within individual correlations between measures made in the most recent GCRC exam with measures made in a prior exam and demonstrated excellent levels of agreement for BMI (r=.91); waist circumference (0.91); FVC (0.88); and FEV1 (0.86). As expected due to higher biological and measurement variability, 149 somewhat lower 3-year correlations were demonstrated for SBP (0.56); Diastolic BP (0.48); AHI (0.62); and nocturnal oxygen desaturation (0.60). NHLBI Candidate-gene Association Resource. The NHLBI initiated the Candidate gene Association Resource (CARe) to create a shared genotype/phenotype resource for analyses of the association of genotypes with phenotypes relevant to the mission of the NHLBI. The resource comprises nine cohort studies funded by the NHLBI: Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC), Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS), Cleveland Family Study (CFS), Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA), Cooperative Study of Sickle Cell Disease (CSSCD), Framingham Heart Study (FHS), Jackson Heart Study (JHS), Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), and the Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS). A database of genotype and phenotype data will be created that includes records for approximately 50,000 study participants with approximately 50,000 SNPs from more than 1,200 selected candidate genes. In addition, a genome wide association study using a 1,000K SNP Chip will be conducted on approximately 9,500 African American participants drawn from the 50,000 participants in the nine cohorts.

The 5,888 study participants were recruited from four U.S. communities and have undergone extensive clinic examinations for evaluation of markers of subclinical cardiovascular disease. The original cohort, enrolled in 1989-90, totaled 5,201 participants. A supplemental cohort of 687 predominantly African-American participants was enrolled in 1992-93.  Clinic examinations were performed at study baseline and at annual visits through 1998-1999, and again in 2005-2006. Examination components included medical and personal history, medication inventory, ECG, blood pressure, anthropometry, assessment of physical and cognitive function, and depression screening. Other components done less frequently included phlebotomy, spirometry, echocardiography, carotid ultrasound, cerebral magnetic resonance imaging, measurement of ankle-brachial index and retinal exam. Participants were contacted by telephone annually between exams to collect information about hospitalizations and potential cardiovascular events. Since 1999, participants have been contacted every six months by phone, primarily to identify cardiovascular events and to assess physical and cognitive health.  Standard protocols for the identification and adjudication of events were implemented during follow-up.

phs000289.v2.p1,c1,National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) GENEVA Genome-Wide Association Study of Venous Thrombosis (GWAS of VTE),parent,2024-05-09,"Name: Mayo_VTE_GRU_, short name: Mayo_VTE.","Overview: Our overall long-term goal is to determine risk factors for the complex (multifactorial) disease, venous thromboembolism (VTE), that will allow physicians to stratify individual patient risk and target VTE prophylaxis to those who would benefit most. In this genome-wide association case-control study (1300 cases and 1300 controls) we hope to identify susceptibility variants for VTE. Mutations within genes encoding for important components of the anticoagulant, procoagulant, fibrinolytic, and innate immunity pathways are risk factors for VTE. We hypothesize that other genes within these four pathways or within other pathways also are VTE disease-susceptibility genes. Therefore, we performed a genome wide association (GWA) screen and analysis using the Illumina 660W platform to identify SNPs within 1,300 clinic-based, non-cancer VTE cases primarily from Minnesota and the upper Midwest USA, and 1300 clinic-based, unrelated controls frequency-matched on patient age, gender, myocardial infarction/stroke status and state of residence. This is a subset of a slightly larger candidate gene study using 1500 case-control pairs to identify haplotype-tagging SNPs (ht-SNPs) in a large set of candidate genes (n~750) within the anticoagulant, procoagulant, fibrinolytic, and innate immunity pathways. Study Populations. Cases. VTE cases were consecutive Mayo Clinic outpatients with objectively-diagnosed deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and/or pulmonary embolism (PE) residing in the upper Midwest and referred by Mayo Clinic physician to the Mayo Clinic Special Coagulation Laboratory for clinical diagnostic testing to evaluate for an acquired or inherited thrombophilia, or to the Mayo Clinic Thrombophilia Center. Any person contacted to be a control but discovered to have had a VTE was evaluated for inclusion as a case. Cases were primarily residents from Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, Michigan, Illinois, North or South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Missouri and Indiana. A DVT or PE was categorized as objectively diagnosed when (a) confirmed by venography or pulmonary angiography, or pathology examination of thrombus removed at surgery, or (b) if at least one non-invasive test (compression duplex ultrasonography, lung scan, computed tomography scan, magnetic resonance imaging) was positive. A VTE was defined as:  Proximal leg deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which includes the common iliac, internal iliac, external iliac, common femoral, superficial [now termed ""femoral""] femoral, deep femoral [sometimes referred to as ""profunda"" femoral] and/or popliteal veins. (Note: greater and lesser saphenous veins, or other superficial or perforator veins, were not included as proximal or distal leg DVT). Distal leg DVT (or ""isolated calf DVT""), which includes the anterior tibial, posterior tibial and/or peroneal veins. (Note: gastrocnemius, soleal and/or sural [e.g., ""deep muscular veins"" of the calf] vein thrombosis was not included as distal leg DVT). Arm DVT, which includes the axillary, subclavian and/or innominate (brachiocephalic) veins. (Note: jugular [internal or external], cephalic and brachial vein thrombosis was not included in ""arm DVT""). Hepatic, portal, splenic, superior or inferior mesenteric, and/or renal vein thrombosis. (Note: ovarian, testicular, peri-prostatic and/or pelvic vein thrombosis was not included). Cerebral vein thrombosis (includes cerebral or dural sinus or vein, saggital sinus or vein, and/or transverse sinus or vein thrombosis). Inferior vena cava (IVC) thrombosis Superior vena cava (SVC) thrombosis Pulmonary embolism   Patients with VTE related to active cancer, antiphospholipid syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, vasculitis, a rheumatoid or other autoimmune disorder, a vascular anomaly (e.g., Klippel-Trénaunay syndrome, etc.), heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, or a mechanical cause for DVT (e.g., arm DVT or SVC thrombosis related to a central venous catheter or transvenous pacemaker, portal and/or splenic vein thrombosis related to liver cirrhosis, IVC thrombosis related to retroperitoneal fibrosis, etc.), with hemodialysis arteriovenous fistula thrombosis, or with prior liver or bone marrow transplantation were excluded.  Controls. A Mayo Clinic outpatient control group was prospectively recruited for this study. Controls were frequency-matched on the age group (18-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60-69, 70-79, and 80+ years), sex, myocardial infarction/stroke status, and state of residence distribution of the cases. We selected clinic-based controls using a controls' database of persons undergoing general medical examinations in the Mayo Clinic Departments of General Internal Medicine or Primary Care Internal Medicine. Additionally persons undergoing evaluation at the Mayo Clinic Sports Medicine Center, and the Department of Family Medicine were screened for inclusion as controls. This study is part of the Gene Environment Association Studies initiative (GENEVA, http://www.genevastudy.org) funded by the trans-NIH Genes, Environment, and Health Initiative (GEI). The overarching goal is to identify novel genetic factors that contribute to venous thrombosis through large-scale genome-wide association studies of 1,300 clinic-based, VTE cases and 1300 clinic-based, unrelated controls. Genotyping was performed at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Inherited Disease Research (CIDR). Data cleaning and harmonization were done at the GEI-funded GENEVA Coordinating Center at the University of Washington.

These and related diseases that are of high impact to public health and individuals from diverse racial and ethnic groups will be studied. These data may help researchers understand the causes of disease, contributing to better ways to prevent, diagnose, and treat diseases, as well as determine whether to tailor prevention and treatments to specific populations. This could lead to more effective treatments and reduce the likelihood of side effects. GO-ESP is comprised of five collaborative components: 3 cohort consortia - HeartGO, LungGO, and WHISP - and 2 sequencing centers - BroadGO and SeattleGO. The exome sequencing asthma project includes 200 African-Americans with asthma from the NHLBI multicenter Severe Asthma Research Program (SARP). SARP participants were recruited at the NHLBI SARP sites with an emphasis on recruiting severe asthmatics (Moore et al., Am J Respir Crit Care Med, 2010. PMID: 19892860). Asthma status was based on both a physician's diagnosis and either bronchodilator reversibility or hyper-responsiveness to methacholine as well as less than 5 pack years of smoking. All subjects were carefully characterized using the standardized SARP protocol which included spirometry (medication withheld), maximum bronchodilator reversibility, hyper-responsiveness to methacholine (not performed in subjects with low baseline FEV1), skin-tests to common allergens, questionnaires on health care utilization and medication use and sputum, lung imaging and bronchoscopy in a subset.

This project established a racially diverse cohort that is sufficiently large and appropriately designed for genome-wide association analysis of COPD. A total of 10,720 subjects were recruited, including control smokers and nonsmokers, definite COPD cases (GOLD Stage 2 to 4), and subjects not included in either group (GOLD 1 and PRISm). This cohort is being used for cross-sectional analysis, and long-term longitudinal follow-up visits after five years and after ten years are also being performed. The primary focus of the study is to identify the genetic risk factors that determine susceptibility for COPD and COPD-related phenotypes. Detailed phenotyping of both cases and controls, including chest CT scan assessment of emphysema and airway disease, will allow identification of genetic determinants for the heterogeneous components of the COPD syndrome. The aims for this study are:  Precise phenotypic characterization of COPD subjects using computed tomography, as well as clinical and physiological measures, that will provide data to enable the broad COPD syndrome to be decomposed into clinically significant subtype; Genome-wide association studies will identify genetic determinants for COPD susceptibility that will provide insight into clinically relevant COPD subtypes; Distinct genetic determinants influence the development of emphysema and airway disease.

The CFS was designed to provide fundamental epidemiological data on genetic and non-genetic risk factors for sleep disordered breathing (SDB). In brief, the CFS is a family-based study that enrolled a total of 2284 individuals from 361 families between 1990 and 2006. The sample was selected by identifying affected probands who had laboratory diagnosed obstructive sleep apnea. All first degree relatives, spouses and available second degree relatives of affected probands were studied. In addition, during the first 5 study years, neighborhood control families were identified through a neighborhood proband, and his/her spouses and first degree relatives. Each exam, occurring at approximately 4 year intervals, included new enrollment as well as follow up exams for previously enrolled subjects. For the first three visits, data, including an overnight sleep study, were collected in the participants' homes while the last visit occurred in a general clinical research center (GCRC). Phenotypic characterization of the entire cohort included overnight sleep apnea studies, blood pressure, spirometry, anthropometry and questionnaires. The GCRC exam (n=735 selected individuals) included more comprehensive phenotype data on a focused subsample of the larger cohort, to permit linking SDB phenotypes with cardio-metabolic phenotypes, with an interest in identifying genetic loci that are associated with these related phenotypes. In this last round of data collection, a subset of 735 individuals was selected based on expected genetic informativity by choosing pedigrees where siblings had extremes of the apnea hypopnea index (AHI). Participants underwent detailed phenotyping including laboratory polysomnography (PSG), ECG, spirometry, nasal and oral acoustic reflectometry, vigilance testing, and blood and urine collection before and after sleep and after an oral glucose tolerance test. A wide range of biochemical measures of inflammation and metabolism were assayed by a Core Laboratory at the University of Vermont. 994 individuals were sequenced as part of TOPMed Phase 1, including 507 African-Americans and 487 European-Americans. Among the sequenced individuals, 156 were probands with diagnosed sleep apnea, an additional 706 were members of families with probands, and 132 were from neighborhood control families.  298 individuals were sequenced as part of TOPMed Phase 3.5, including 169 African-Americans and 129 European-Americans. Among the newly sequenced individuals, 33 were probands with diagnosed sleep apnea, an additional 214 were members of families with probands, and 51 were from neighborhood control families.

The OOA population of Lancaster County, PA immigrated to the Colonies from Western Europe in the early 1700's. There are now over 30,000 OOA individuals in the Lancaster area, nearly all of whom can trace their ancestry back 12-14 generations to approximately 700 founders. Investigators at the University of Maryland School of Medicine have been studying the genetic determinants of cardiometabolic health in this population since 1993. To date, over 7,000 Amish adults have participated in one or more of our studies. Due to their ancestral history, the OOA may be enriched for rare variants that arose in the population from a single founder (or small number of founders) and propagated through genetic drift. Many of these variants have large effect sizes and identifying them can lead to new biological insights about health and disease. The parent study for this WGS project provides one (of multiple) examples. In our parent study, we identified through a genome-wide association analysis a haplotype that was highly enriched in the OOA that is associated with very high LDL-cholesterol levels. At the present time, the identity of the causative SNP - and even the implicated gene - is not known because the associated haplotype contains numerous genes, none of which are obvious lipid candidate genes. A major goal of the WGS that will be obtained through the NHLBI TOPMed Consortium will be to identify functional variants that underlie some of the large effect associations observed in this unique population.

The JHS is a large, community-based, observational study whose 5306 participants were recruited from among the non-institutionalized African-American adults from urban and rural areas of the three counties (Hinds, Madison, and Rankin) that make up the Jackson, MS, metropolitan statistical area (MSA). Jackson is the capital of Mississippi, the state with the largest percentage (36.3%) of African Americans in the United States. The JHS design included participants from the Jackson ARIC study who had originally been recruited through random selection from a drivers' license registry. Approximately six months before the JHS was to begin, an amendment to the federal Driver's Privacy Protection Act was passed that changed the level of consent for public release of personal information from driver's license lists from an ""opt out"" to an ""opt in"" basis. The Mississippi Highway Patrol was no longer able to release a complete listing of all persons with driver's licenses or state identification cards, which prevented its use in the JHS. New JHS participants were chosen randomly from the Accudata America commercial listing, which provides householder name, address, zip code, phone number (if available), age group in decades, and family components. The Accudata list was deemed to provide the most complete count of households for individuals aged 55 years and older in the Jackson MSA. A structured volunteer sample was also included in which demographic cells for recruitment were designed to mirror the eligible population. Enrollment was opened to volunteers who met census-derived age, sex, and socioeconomic status (SES) eligibility criteria for the Jackson MSA. In addition, a family component was included in the JHS. The sampling frame for the family study was a participant in any one of the ARlC, random, or volunteer samples whose family size met eligibility requirements. Eligibility included having at least two full siblings and four first degree relatives (parents, siblings, children over the age of 21) who lived in the Jackson MSA and who were willing to participate in the study. No upper age limit was placed on the family sample. Known contact information was obtained during the baseline clinic examination from the index family member with a verbal pedigree format to identify name(s), age(s), address (es), and telephone number(s). Recruitment was limited to persons 35-84 years old except in the family cohort, where those 21 years old and above were eligible.

The individuals sequenced here represent a small subset of the parent study (described below) and were carefully selected for the purpose of creating a Samoan-specific reference panel for imputation back into the parent study. The INFOSTIP algorithm of Gusev et. al. (2012) (PMID: 22135348) was used to optimally choose the individuals for sequencing. The research goal of the parent study (dbGaP ID phs000914) is to identify genetic variation that increases susceptibility to obesity and cardiometabolic phenotypes among adult Samoans using genome-wide association (GWAS) methods. DNA from peripheral blood and phenotypic information were collected from 3,119 adult Samoans, 23 to 70 years of age. The participants reside throughout the independent nation of Samoa, which is experiencing economic development and the nutrition transition. Genotyping was performed with the Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP 6.0 Array using a panel of approximately 900,000 SNPs. Anthropometric, fasting blood biomarkers and detailed dietary, physical activity, health and socio-demographic variables were collected. We are replicating the GWAS findings in an independent sample of 2,500 Samoans from earlier studies. After replication of genomic regions and informative SNPs in those regions, we will determine sequences of the important genes, and determine the specific genetic variants in the sequenced genes that are associated with adiposity and related cardiometabolic conditions. We will also identify gene by environment interactions, focusing on dietary intake patterns and nutrients.

We focus on asthma because of its public health significance. Asthma affects 26 million U.S. children and adults, remains a major cause of morbidity (one-half million hospitalizations a year) and is the most common cause of school and work days lost. Asthma-related costs are estimated to be over $12.7 billion annually. The Asthma Probands for both the extended pedigrees and the trios utilized in this study were selected on the basis of a physician diagnosis of asthma; a history of recurrent asthma attacks or at least 2 respiratory symptoms; and either airway hyperresponsiveness to methacholine or significant response to bronchodilator (Albuterol) administration. These criteria are identical to the criteria used in the Childhood Asthma Management Program (CAMP). The three primary goals of this project are to: (1) identify common and rare genetic variants that determine asthma and its associated phenotypes (height, weight, IgE level, lung function, bronchodilator response, steroid treatment response) through whole genome sequencing (WGS); (2) perform novel family based association analysis of our WGS data to identify novel genes for asthma; and (3) integrate epigenomic and transcriptomic data with our WGS data and determine the epistatic interactions present using systems genomics approaches. Identification of the molecular determinants of asthma remains an important priority in translational science. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been successful in this regard, identifying at least 10 novel susceptibility genes for asthma. However, as with most complex traits, the variants identified by GWAS explain only a fraction of the estimated heritability of this disorder. Herein, we propose a novel family-based study design and state-of-the-art genome sequencing techniques to map a set of sequence variants for asthma and its associated phenotypes and assess the interrelationships of the identified genes and variants using systems genomics methods. We have assembled a team of investigators highly-skilled and expert in whole genome sequencing (Drs. Michael Cho and Benjamin Raby), genetic association analysis (Drs. Scott T. Weiss, Jessica Lasky-Su and Christoph Lange), integrative genomics (Drs. Raby, Kelan Tantisira, Augusto Litonjua and Dawn DeMeo), and systems genomics (Drs. Weiss, Amitabh Sharma, Lange and Raby) to address this important problem with both a novel study design and data set.

The Women's Genome Health Study (WGHS) is a prospective cohort comprised of over 25,000 initially healthy female health professionals enrolled in the Women's Health Study, which began in 1992-1994. All participants in WGHS provided baseline blood samples and extensive survey data. Women who reported atrial fibrillation during the course of the study were asked to report diagnoses of AF at baseline, 48 months, and then annually thereafter. Participants enrolled in the continued observational follow-up who reported an incident AF event on at least one yearly questionnaire were sent an additional questionnaire to confirm the episode and to collect additional information. They were also asked for permission to review their medical records, particularly available ECGs, rhythm strips, 24-hour ECGs, and information on cardiac structure and function. For all deceased participants who reported AF during the trial and extended follow-up period, family members were contacted to obtain consent and additional relevant information. An end-point committee of physicians reviewed medical records for reported events according to predefined criteria. An incident AF event was confirmed if there was ECG evidence of AF or if a medical report clearly indicated a personal history of AF. The earliest date in the medical records when documentation was believed to have occurred was set as the date of onset of AF.

Platelet activation pathways reflecting hemostasis and thrombosis are the underlying substrate for many cardiovascular diseases and related acute events. To overcome GWAS limitations, genomic studies are needed that integrate molecular surrogates for platelet-related phenotypes assayed in cell-based models derived from individuals of known genotypes and phenotypes. In our GWAS study of native platelet aggregation phenotypes and aggregation in response to low dose aspirin in 2200 subjects (GeneSTAR, Genetic Study of Aspirin Responsiveness), important genome wide ""signals"" (p<5x10-8) associated with native platelet aggregation and important ""signals"" associated with platelet responsiveness to aspirin were identified and replicated. Although we are currently performing functional genomics studies to elucidate our most promising findings in known genes (PEAR1, MET, PIKC3G), most ""signals"" occurred in intergenic regions or in introns. Mechanistic interpretation is limited by uncertainty as to which gene(s) are up- or down-regulated in the presence of most SNP modifications. In this 3 phase proposal, we will (1) create pluripotent stem cells (iPS) from peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and then differentiate these stem cells into megakaryocytes (2) develop an efficient strategy to produce iPS and megakaryocytes using a novel pooling method, and (3) produce iPS and megakaryocytes from 250 subjects in GeneSTAR (European Americans and African Americans), selected based on specific hypotheses derived from GWAS signals in native and post aspirin platelet function; characterize genetic mRNA transcripts using a comprehensive Affymetrix array; measure protein expression for transcripts of interest using mass spectrometry; examine mRNA and protein expression patterns for each GWAS signal to determine the functional pathway(s) involved in native platelet phenotypes; and examine the functional genomics of variations in responsiveness to aspirin using our prior genotyped and phenotyped population. Precise information about the exact functional processes in megakaryocytes and platelets may lead to innovative and tailored approaches to risk assessment and novel therapeutic targets to prevent first and recurrent cardiovascular and related thrombotic events.

This study aims to comprehensively interrogate the genomes of African American sarcoidosis families. Sarcoidosis is characterized by a hyperimmune response resulting in granuloma formation in multiple organs. It affects African Americans (AAs) more frequently and more severely than whites. While previous linkage, admixture, candidate gene and genome-wide association (GWA) studies show statistically compelling effects, causal variants are still unknown and much of sarcoidosis heritability is yet to be explained. This ""missing"" heritability likely includes effects of both common (minor allele frequency (MAF)>5%) and rare variants (MAF<5%), since, in AAs, the former are inadequately represented and the latter are completely unexplored by commercial genotyping arrays. These facts, coupled with the availability of next-generation sequencing compel us to perform an exhaustive search for genetic variants that form the basis of sarcoidosis. The data generated are certain to identify candidate causal variants, provide fundamental insight for functional studies and lead to important new hypotheses of inflammation resulting in new treatments in not only sarcoidosis but other inflammatory diseases as well.

The San Antonio Family Heart Study (SAFHS) is a complex pedigree-based mixed longitudinal study designed to identify low frequency or rare variants influencing susceptibility to cardiovascular disease, using whole genome sequence (WGS) information from 2,590 individuals in large Mexican American pedigrees from San Antonio, Texas. The major objectives of this study are to identify low frequency or rare variants in and around known common variant signals for CVD, as well as to find novel low frequency or rare variants influencing susceptibility to CVD. WGS of the SAFHS cohort has been obtained through three efforts. Approximately 540 WGS were performed commercially at 50X by Complete Genomics, Inc (CGI) as part of the large T2D-GENES Project. The phenotype and genotype data for this group is available at dbGaP under accession number phs000462. An additional ~900 WGS at 30X were obtained through Illumina as part of the R01HL113322 ""Whole Genome Sequencing to Identify Causal Genetic Variants Influencing CVD Risk"" project. Finally, ~1,150 WGS at 30X WGS were obtained through Illumina funded by a supplement as part of the NHLBI's TOPMed program. Extensive phenotype data are provided for sequenced individuals primarily obtained from the P01HL45522 ""Genetics of Atherosclerosis in Mexican Americans"" for adults and R01HD049051 for children in these same families. Phenotype information was collected between 1991 and 2016. For this dataset, the SAFHS appellation represents an amalgamation of the original SAFHS participants and an expansion that reexamined families previously recruited for the San Antonio Family Diabetes Study (R01DK042273) and the San Antonio Family Gall Bladder Study (R01DK053889). Due to this substantial examination history, participants may have information from up to five visits. The clinical variables reported are coordinated with TOPMed and include major adverse cardiac events (MACE), T2D status and age at diagnosis, glycemic traits (fasting glucose and insulin), blood pressure, blood lipids (total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, calculated LDL cholesterol and triglycerides). Additional phenotype data include the medication status at each visit, classified in four categories as any current use of diabetes, hypertension or lipid-lowering medications, and, for females, current use of female hormones. Anthropometric measurements include age, sex, height, weight, hip circumference, waist circumference and derived ratios. PBMC derived gene expression assays for a subset of ~1,060 individuals obtained using the Illumina Sentrix-6 chip is also available from the baseline examination.

Commencing in 2003, the siblings, their offspring, and the coparent of the offspring participated in a 2 week trial of aspirin 81 mg/day with pre and post ex vivo platelet function assessed using multiple agonists in whole blood and platelet rich plasma. Extensive additional cardiovascular testing and risk assessment was done at baseline and serially. Follow-up was carried out to determine incident cardiovascular disease, stroke, peripheral arterial disease, diabetes, cancer, and related comorbidities, from 5 to 30 years after study entry. The goal of several additional phenotyping and interventional substudies has been to discover and amplify understanding of the mechanisms of atherogenic vascular diseases and attendant comorbidities.

The longitudinal GENOA Study recruited European-American and African-American sibships with at least 2 individuals with clinically diagnosed essential hypertension before age 60 years. All other members of the sibship were invited to participate regardless of their hypertension status. Participants were diagnosed with hypertension if they had either 1) a previous clinical diagnosis of hypertension by a physician with current anti-hypertensive treatment, or 2) an average systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mm Hg based on the second and third readings at the time of their clinic visit. The Family Blood Pressure Program (FBPP), GENOA's parent program, is an unprecedented collaboration to identify genes influencing blood pressure (BP) levels, hypertension, and its target-organ damage. This program has conducted over 21,000 physical examinations, assembled a shared database of several hundred BP and hypertension-related phenotypic measurements, completed genome-wide linkage analyses for BP, hypertension, and hypertension associated risk factors and complications, and published over 130 manuscripts on program findings.

The study recruited Caucasian participants primarily from three-generational pedigrees from two NHLBI Family Heart Study (FHS) field centers (Minneapolis, MN and Salt Lake City, UT). Only families with at least two siblings were recruited and only participants who did not take lipid-lowering agents (pharmaceuticals or nutraceuticals) for at least 4 weeks prior to the initial visit were included. The diet intervention followed the protocol of Patsch et al. (1992). The whipping cream (83% fat) meal had 700 Calories/m2 body surface area (2.93 mJ/m2 body surface area): 3% of calories were derived from protein (instant nonfat dry milk) and 14% from carbohydrate (sugar). The ratio of polyunsaturated to saturated fat was 0.06 and the cholesterol content of the average meal was 240 mg. The mixture was blended with ice and flavorings. Blood samples were drawn immediately before (fasting) and at 3.5 and 6 hours after consuming the high-fat meal. The diet intervention was administered at baseline as well as after a 3-week treatment with 160 mg micronized fenofibrate. Participants were given the option to complete one or both (diet and drug) interventions. Of all participants, 1079 had phenotypic data and provided appropriate consent, and underwent whole genome sequencing through the Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) program.

MESA researchers study a diverse, population-based sample of 6,814 asymptomatic men and women aged 45-84. Thirty-eight percent of the recruited participants are white, 28 percent African-American, 22 percent Hispanic, and 12 percent Asian, predominantly of Chinese descent. Comprehensive phenotypic and pedigree data for MESA study participants are available through dbGaP entry phs000209. MESA Participants were recruited from six field centers across the United States: Wake Forest University, Columbia University, Johns Hopkins University, University of Minnesota, Northwestern University and University of California - Los Angeles. Each participant received an extensive physical exam and determination of coronary calcification, ventricular mass and function, flow-mediated endothelial vasodilation, carotid intimal-medial wall thickness and presence of echogenic lucencies in the carotid artery, lower extremity vascular insufficiency, arterial wave forms, electrocardiographic (ECG) measures, standard coronary risk factors, sociodemographic factors, lifestyle factors, and psychosocial factors. Selected repetition of subclinical disease measures and risk factors at follow-up visits allows study of the progression of disease. Blood samples have been assayed for putative biochemical risk factors and stored for case-control studies. DNA has been extracted and lymphocytes cryopreserved (for possible immortalization) for study of candidate genes and possibly, genome-wide scanning, expression, and other genetic techniques. Participants are being followed for identification and characterization of cardiovascular disease events, including acute myocardial infarction and other forms of coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, and congestive heart failure; for cardiovascular disease interventions; and for mortality. In addition to the six Field Centers, MESA involves a Coordinating Center, a Central Laboratory, and Central Reading Centers for Computed Tomography (CT), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Ultrasound, and Electrocardiography (ECG). Protocol development, staff training, and pilot testing were performed in the first 18 months of the study. The first examination took place over two years, from July 2000 - July 2002. It was followed by five examination periods that were 17-20 months in length. Participants have been contacted every 9 to 12 months throughout the study to assess clinical morbidity and mortality. MESA Family The general goal of the MESA Family Study, an ancillary study to MESA funded by a grant from NHLBI, is to apply modern genetic analysis and genotyping methodologies to delineate the genetic determinants of early atherosclerosis. This is being accomplished by utilizing all the current organizational structures of the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) and Genetic Centers at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and University of Virginia. In the MESA Family Study, the goal is to locate and identify genes contributing to the genetic risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD), by looking at the early changes of atherosclerosis within families (mainly siblings). 2128 individuals from 594 families, yielding 3,026 sibpairs divided between African Americans and Hispanic-Americans, were recruited by utilizing the existing framework of MESA. MESA Family studied siblings of index subjects from the MESA study and from new sibpair families (with the same demographic characteristics) and is determining the extent of genetic contribution to the variation in coronary calcium (obtained via CT Scan) and carotid artery wall thickness (B-mode ultrasound) in the two largest non-majority U.S. populations. In a small proportion of subjects, parents of MESA index subjects participating in MESA Family were studied but only to have blood drawn for genotyping. The MESA Family cohort was recruited from the six MESA Field Centers. MESA Family participants underwent the same examination as MESA participants during May 2004 - May 2007. DNA was extracted and lymphocytes immortalized for study of candidate genes, genome-wide linkage scanning, and analyzed for linkage with these subclinical cardiovascular traits. While linkage analysis is the primary approach being used, an additional aspect of the MESA Family Study takes advantage of the existing MESA study population for testing a variety of candidate genes for association with the same subclinical traits. Genotyping and data analysis will occur throughout the study.

MESA researchers study a diverse, population-based sample of 6,814 asymptomatic men and women aged 45-84. Thirty-eight percent of the recruited participants are white, 28 percent African-American, 22 percent Hispanic, and 12 percent Asian, predominantly of Chinese descent. Comprehensive phenotypic and pedigree data for MESA study participants are available through dbGaP entry phs000209. MESA Participants were recruited from six field centers across the United States: Wake Forest University, Columbia University, Johns Hopkins University, University of Minnesota, Northwestern University and University of California - Los Angeles. Each participant received an extensive physical exam and determination of coronary calcification, ventricular mass and function, flow-mediated endothelial vasodilation, carotid intimal-medial wall thickness and presence of echogenic lucencies in the carotid artery, lower extremity vascular insufficiency, arterial wave forms, electrocardiographic (ECG) measures, standard coronary risk factors, sociodemographic factors, lifestyle factors, and psychosocial factors. Selected repetition of subclinical disease measures and risk factors at follow-up visits allows study of the progression of disease. Blood samples have been assayed for putative biochemical risk factors and stored for case-control studies. DNA has been extracted and lymphocytes cryopreserved (for possible immortalization) for study of candidate genes and possibly, genome-wide scanning, expression, and other genetic techniques. Participants are being followed for identification and characterization of cardiovascular disease events, including acute myocardial infarction and other forms of coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, and congestive heart failure; for cardiovascular disease interventions; and for mortality. In addition to the six Field Centers, MESA involves a Coordinating Center, a Central Laboratory, and Central Reading Centers for Computed Tomography (CT), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Ultrasound, and Electrocardiography (ECG). Protocol development, staff training, and pilot testing were performed in the first 18 months of the study. The first examination took place over two years, from July 2000 - July 2002. It was followed by five examination periods that were 17-20 months in length. Participants have been contacted every 9 to 12 months throughout the study to assess clinical morbidity and mortality. MESA Family The general goal of the MESA Family Study, an ancillary study to MESA funded by a grant from NHLBI, is to apply modern genetic analysis and genotyping methodologies to delineate the genetic determinants of early atherosclerosis. This is being accomplished by utilizing all the current organizational structures of the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) and Genetic Centers at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and University of Virginia. In the MESA Family Study, the goal is to locate and identify genes contributing to the genetic risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD), by looking at the early changes of atherosclerosis within families (mainly siblings). 2128 individuals from 594 families, yielding 3,026 sibpairs divided between African Americans and Hispanic-Americans, were recruited by utilizing the existing framework of MESA. MESA Family studied siblings of index subjects from the MESA study and from new sibpair families (with the same demographic characteristics) and is determining the extent of genetic contribution to the variation in coronary calcium (obtained via CT Scan) and carotid artery wall thickness (B-mode ultrasound) in the two largest non-majority U.S. populations. In a small proportion of subjects, parents of MESA index subjects participating in MESA Family were studied but only to have blood drawn for genotyping. The MESA Family cohort was recruited from the six MESA Field Centers. MESA Family participants underwent the same examination as MESA participants during May 2004 - May 2007. DNA was extracted and lymphocytes immortalized for study of candidate genes, genome-wide linkage scanning, and analyzed for linkage with these subclinical cardiovascular traits. While linkage analysis is the primary approach being used, an additional aspect of the MESA Family Study takes advantage of the existing MESA study population for testing a variety of candidate genes for association with the same subclinical traits. Genotyping and data analysis will occur throughout the study.

Atrial fibrillation is a major clinical and public health problem that is related to atrial pathologic remodeling. Few tools are available to quantify the activity or extent of this remodeling, rendering it difficult to identify individuals at risk for AF. Previous studies have suggested an important role for miRNA in cardiovascular disease through gene expression regulation, making this a promising avenue for studying AF mechanisms. The aim of the study is to determine the time-dependent changes to key circulating miRNAs in a model of planned atrial injury and remodeling via ablation. Such knowledge might provide additional insight into the biology and activity of the acute atrial injury response, and furthermore, inform new targets for development of preventative interventions or allow for better AF risk stratification. To assess pathways regulating atrial pathological remodeling, patient blood samples are collected prior to their ablation procedures and also at a regularly scheduled 1-month follow-up appointment. Plasma expression of miRNA is measured using high-throughput quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), providing novel insights into the regulatory processes underlying AF, as well as acute atrial injury in vivo. Additionally, data collected from whole-genome sequencing (WGS) is used to supplement miRNA analyses and further explore new relations between genes and abnormal heart rhythm.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is characterized by the presence of sickle hemoglobin (HbS) within circulating erythrocytes resulting in hemolytic anemia, vascular occlusion, and end organ damage due to alterations in the shape and deformability of the cell membrane. The disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, and is most commonly caused by a single nucleotide substitution in the hemoglobin subunit beta (HBB) gene located on chromosome 11. Participants in this study include children with SCD treated with hydroxyurea to pharmacologically increase fetal hemoglobin (HbF) levels and reduce disease severity. Therefore, the primary phenotype of interest in this study is the change in HbF levels in response to hydroxyurea treatment. Genetic factors have been shown to influence inter-individual variation in drug response, and identification of novel genes and variants associated with clinical outcomes in SCD will be achieved through collaboration between Baylor College of Medicine, Augusta University, Columbia University Medical Center, Emory University School of Medicine and Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, and St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.

Started in 2007, the Study of Asthma Phenotypes and Pharmacogenomic Interactions by Race-ethnicity (SAPPHIRE) is one of the largest asthma cohort studies in the United States. Its overarching goal is to elucidate the genetic underpinnings of asthma and asthma medication treatment response. The cohort was recruited from a large health care system serving southeast Michigan and the Detroit metropolitan area, and the participants broadly represent the demographic and socioeconomic diversity of the region. Control participants (i.e., patients without a diagnosis with asthma) were recruited from the same health system and geographic region. By virtue of their health system enrollment, both asthma case and control patients have longitudinal clinical information which was routinely collected as part of their care. Both case and control patients underwent at detailed evaluation at the time of enrollment which included lung function testing and bronchodilator response. The SAPPHIRE cohort is a member of the Asthma Translational Genomics Collaborative (ATGC). The latter was selected for whole genome sequencing in Phase 3 of the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute's TOPMed Program.

Hemophilia A and B are X-linked bleeding disorders resulting from a deficiency in coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) or factor IX (FIX), respectively. Hemophilia affects approximately 1/5000 male births worldwide, and results in premature death and disability due to bleeding if coagulation factor replacement therapy is not used effectively. Hemophilia is clinically categorized by coagulation factor activity levels and ranges in severity from mild (6% to 30%) to moderate (1-5%) to severe (<1%). Many female ""carriers"" of hemophilia also have decreased factor activity and morbidity from bleeding. Hemophilia A and B are almost always caused by identifiable mutations in the F8 and F9 genes, respectively, and these mutations are found throughout the structural genes. Although the hemophilias are monogenic disorders, there are wide variations in disease severity and therapeutic outcomes which are not readily explained by the disease causing mutations alone. The My Life Our Future (MLOF) project (www.mylifeourfuture.org) is a national resource developed by a partnership of BloodworksNW (BWNW, formerly the Puget Sound Blood Center), the American Thrombosis and Hemostasis Network (ATHN), the National Hemophilia Foundation (NHF) and Bioverativ, to provide free F8 and F9 gene variant analysis to patients with hemophilia A or B, and to establish a research repository of DNA sequence, DNA, RNA, buffy coat, serum and plasma. The sequence analysis and serum samples are linked to a phenotypic database hosted by ATHN, with samples submitted and clinical data entered at ~100 hemophilia treatment centers (HTCs) nationwide. (See ATHN Research Report Brief in the resource center at www.athn.org). MLOF has become the largest hemophilia genetic project worldwide. The roles of the MLOF partners are: BWNW, to serve as the central laboratory for the project and house the research repository; ATHN, to support and provide the administrative link with HTCs, to facilitate the collection of accurate phenotypic data, to conduct research review and approval for use of the repository and with BWNW to provide samples and data for research projects; NHF, to provide consumer education and facilitate consumer input into the project; and Bioverativ, to provide financial support and scientific input. The project is governed by a Steering Committee consisting of one representative from each organization. Subject samples chosen from the MLOF parent study for TOPMed and WGS were drawn from those who gave (or parents gave) informed consent for the Research Repository and included patients of all severities and type, but with an emphasis on those with severe hemophilia and others at increased risk of neutralizing antibody (inhibitor) formation and who had samples in the Research Repository (plasma, serum, RNA) for potential additional -omic studies. Also included were samples from subjects where a likely causative variant for hemophilia was not found in the F8 or F9 coding region, intron-exon boundaries or immediate upstream and downstream regions. Since hemophilia is an X-linked disorder, the majority of subjects are male. Racial distribution is similar to the overall population distribution.

Atrial fibrillation (AF), the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia, is the primary cause of many hospital admissions, and is associated with significant secondary morbidity by increasing the risk of stroke, heart failure, and all-cause mortality. The incidence of AF is on the rise, and it is projected that by the year 2050 more than 10 million patients will be affected by AF in the United States alone. Anti-arrhythmic medications have limited success in maintaining sinus rhythm, are associated with side effects, and appear ineffective at reducing mortality compared to a strategy of rate control and anticoagulation. Given the significant morbidity associated with this common arrhythmia, surgical and catheter ablation techniques have been developed to treat AF. However, despite the incorporation of various strategies for ablation, long-term recurrence rates of AF remain higher than 25 percent after ablation. Current techniques for catheter ablation of AF include pulmonary vein isolation and complex fractionated atrial electrogram (CFAE) ablation. However, the contribution of each strategy to long-term procedural success and the relative importance of each strategy for different patients remain unknown. Recent advances in cardiac imaging have allowed detailed analysis of left atrial myocardial anatomy. Parallel advances in molecular genetics have identified several candidate genes involved in familial and non-familial AF. However, the pathophysiology of AF generation and maintenance, and the potential contribution of such genetic or anatomic substrates for patient selection, and for target identification during catheter ablation have not yet been examined. Advances in molecular genetics and imaging, coupled with techniques for endocardial and epicardial mapping in the electrophysiology laboratory present an opportunity to significantly improve our understanding of (1) The relation of paroxysmal versus persistent AF with (a) structural left atrial changes (left/right atrial scar, wall thinning, pulmonary vein anomalies, and coronary sinus dilation) and with (b) candidate genetic variants. (2) The relation of candidate genetic variants with (a) structural left atrial changes and with (b) electrophysiologic properties (atrial effective refractory period (AERP) inhomogeneity, voltage abnormalities, trigger burden and location, C FAE extent and location), (3) The relation of structural left atrial changes with (a) CFAE location as targets for catheter ablation and with (b) reversible conduction block/myocardial injury after pulmonary vein isolation, and (4) Individualized endocardial targets for AF ablation based on candidate genes and anatomic substrates. The proposed study will improve our understanding of the underlying pathophysiology of AF, and may improve current techniques for treatment of this important arrhythmia.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is caused by homozygosity for a single mutation of the beta hemoglobin gene. Despite the constancy of this genetic abnormality, the clinical course of patients with SCD is remarkably variable. SCD can affect the function and cause the failure of multiple organ systems through the pathophysiologic processes of vaso-occlusion and hemolysis. These pathophysiological processes are complex and expected to impact multiple organ systems in a variety of ways. This study, therefore, was designed to identify genetic factors that predispose SCD patients to develop specific end-organ complications and to experience more or less severe clinical courses. We enrolled > 700 patients with Hb SS, Hb S-beta0 thalassemia and HbSC being followed primarily at three southeastern U.S. regional institutions (Duke University Medical Center, University of North Carolina Medical Center, and Emory University Medical Center). Medical information obtained included the presence or absence of specific targeted outcomes (overall disease severity as well as specific types of end organ damage). Clinical data include medical status (history, physical, examination, and laboratory results) and information regarding potentially confounding environmental factors. Limited plasma samples are available for correlative studies (e.g. of cytokine levels, coagulation activation). Targeted SNP for candidate gene analysis as well as GWAS has been performed on most samples. Whole genome sequencing has been conducted through the TOPMed Consortium. The subjects in this analysis were collected as part of a larger study, ""Outcome Modifying Genes in Sickle Cell Disease"" (OMG-SCD) aimed at identifying genetic modifiers for sickle cell disease. More information about the study can be found in Elmariah et al. (2014), PMID: 24478166. Clinical and genetic data have been used to identify genetic characteristics predisposing patients with SCD to a more or less severe overall clinical course as well as to individual organ-specific complications.

The IPM BioMe Biobank, founded in September 2007, is an ongoing, broadly-consented electronic health record (EHR)-linked clinical care biobank that enrolls participants non-selectively from the Mount Sinai Medical Center patient population. BioMe currently comprises >42,000 participants from diverse ancestries, characterized by a broad spectrum of longitudinal biomedical traits. Participants enroll through an opt-in process and consent to be followed throughout their clinical care (past, present, and future) in real-time, allowing us to integrate their genomic information with their EHRs for discovery research and clinical care implementation. BioMe participants consent for recall, based on their genotype and/or phenotype, permitting in-depth follow-up and functional studies for selected participants at any time. Phenotypic and genomic data are stored in a secure database and made available to investigators, contingent on approval by the BioMe Governing Board. BioMe uses a ""data-broker"" system to protect confidentiality. Ancestral diversity - BioMe participants represent a broad racial, ethnic and socioeconomic diversity with a distinct and population-specific disease burden. Specifically, BioMe participants are of African (AA), Hispanic/Latino (HL), European (EA) and other/mixed ancestry (Table 1, Figure 1). BioMe participants are predominantly of African (AA, 24%), Hispanic/Latino (HL, 35%), European (EA, 32%), and other ancestry (OA, 10%) (Table 1, Figure 1). Participants who self-identify as Hispanic/Latino further report to be of Puerto Rican (39%), Dominican (23%), Central/South American (17%), Mexican (5%) or other Hispanic (16%) ancestry. More than 40% of European ancestry participants are genetically determined to be of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry. With this broad ancestral diversity, BioMe is uniquely positioned to examine the impact of demographic and evolutionary forces that have shaped common disease risk. Phenotypes available in BioMe - BioMe has available a high-quality and validated set of fully implemented clinical phenotype data that has been culled by a multi-disciplinary team of experienced investigators, clinicians, information technologists, data-managers, and programmers who apply advanced medical informatics and data mining tools to extract and harmonize EHRs. BioMe, as a cohort, offers great versatility for designing nested case-control sample-sets, particularly for studying longitudinal traits and co-morbidity in disease burden.  ** Biomedical and clinical outcomes: The BioMe Biobank is linked to Mount Sinai's system-wide Epic EHR, which captures a full spectrum of biomedical phenotypes, including clinical outcomes, covariate and exposure data from past, present and future health care encounters. As such, the BioMe Biobank has a longitudinal design as participants consent to make all of their EHR data from past (dating back as far as 2003), present and future inpatient or outpatient encounters available for research, without restriction. The median number of outpatient encounters is 21 per participant, reflecting predominant enrollment of participants with common chronic conditions from primary care facilities. ** Environmental data: The clinical and EHR information is complemented by detailed demographic and lifestyle information, including ancestry, residence history, country of origin, personal and familial medical history, education, socio-economic status, physical activity, smoking, dietary habits, alcohol intake, and body weight history, which is collected in a systematic manner by interview-based questionnaire at time of enrollment. The IPM BioMe Biobank contributed ~10,600 DNA samples for whole genome sequencing to the TOPMed program. Samples were selected for the Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) and the Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) working groups. Using a Case-Definition-Algorithm (CDA), we identified ~4,100 individuals with CAD (~50% women) and ~3,000 individuals as controls (65% women). In addition, we identified ~800 individual with COPD (62% women) and 1800 as controls (72% women). Another 600 BioMe participants with Atrial Fibrillation, all of African ancestry, were included.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a disease state characterized by airflow limitation that is not fully reversible, is the third leading cause of death in the U.S. COPD is a heterogeneous syndrome, with affected individuals demonstrating marked differences in lung structure (emphysema vs. airway disease); physiology (airflow obstruction); and other clinical features (e.g., exacerbations, co-morbid illnesses). Multiple genomic regions influencing COPD susceptibility have been identified by genome-wide association studies (GWAS), and rare coding variants can also influence risk for COPD. However, only a small percentage of the estimated heritability for COPD risk can be explained by known genetic loci. Like most complex diseases, COPD is influenced by multiple genetic determinants (each with modest individual effects). Emerging evidence supports the paradigm that complex disease genetic determinants are part of a network of interacting genes and proteins; perturbations of this network can increase disease risk. To identify this network, multiple Omics data will need to be analyzed with methods to account for nonlinear relationships and interactions between key genes and proteins. Our overall hypothesis is that integrated network analysis of genetic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and epigenetic data from biospecimens ranging from lung tissue to nasal epithelial cells to blood in highly phenotyped subjects will provide insights into COPD pathogenesis and heterogeneity. We will leverage the well-phenotyped, NHLBI-funded Lung Tissue Research Consortium (LTRC) to address these questions. We will perform multi-omics analysis in 1548 lung tissue and blood samples from the LTRC. With these multi-omics data, we will utilize a systems biology approach to understand relationships between multiple genetic determinants and multiple types of Omics data. We will begin by performing single Omics analyses in COPD vs. control lung, nasal, and blood samples. Next, we will integrate single Omics data with genetic variants identified by WGS to assist in fine mapping genetic determinants of COPD. We will then perform integrated network analysis of COPD with genetic and multiple Omics data using correlation-based, gene regulatory, and Bayesian networks. Subjects were recruited from Mayo Clinic, Universities of Colorado, Michigan, and Pittsburg, and Temple University.

Study designed to further our understanding of the pathogenesis of asthma exacerbations in children. Children enrolled in the study (n=217) were all asthmatic and primarily Hispanic white. The children were followed for 18 months until they experienced an asthma exacerbation or completed the follow-up without an exacerbation. The time to the first asthma exacerbation was considered the outcome. The acute and convalescent immune phenotype of each asthma exacerbation was documented.

BADGER is a 56-week randomized, double-blind, three-treatment, three-period cross-over trial that will evaluate the differential improvement in control that is achieved following three separate treatment interventions in children whose asthma is not acceptably controlled on a low dose of ICS (per NAEPP guidelines). All participants will enter an 8-week run-in period during which time they will receive a dose of 1x ICS (fluticasone 200 μg/day). During this 8-week time period, running 2-week averages to establish the lack of acceptable asthma control will be calculated. Thus, a child could qualify for randomization at any time during this 8-week run-in period. This approach should maximize both patient safety and successful enrollment. Children will continue to receive 1x ICS during the entire treatment phase. During each period of the treatment phase, they also will receive one add-on therapy in the form of LABA, LTRA or additional 1x ICS. The order of the add-on therapy assignment will be determined by randomization into one of six treatment sequences (order determined randomly). Each treatment period will be 16 weeks in length; the initial 4 weeks of each period will be considered to be the washout period for the previous treatment. The primary outcome measures will be frequency of asthma exacerbations, asthma control days, and FEV1.

From whole exome sequencing (WES) of >2800 CHD trios, we identified a substantial enrichment of damaging de novo mutations in genes important for cardiogenesis, particularly implicating histone modifier enzyme gene defects. Analysis of whole genome sequencing (WGS) of 350 probands with CHD unexplained by WES and their parents preliminarily implicated de novo mutations in enhancers of genes previously shown to cause CHD in mouse knock out models. Sequencing of RNA (RNAseq) from discarded cardiac tissues from CHD probands has revealed likely causal allele-specific expression (ASE) as well as biallelic loss of expression (LOE). We have also discovered de novo epimutations, differentially methylated regions (DMRs), some with underlying de novo DNA variation, that are detectable in peripheral blood leukocytes and appear to underlie 10% of CHD. Of note, these assorted 'omic' approaches have enabled one another, both for attributing causality and assessing functional impact. Based on these extensive preliminary data, we hypothesize that PCGC probands with uninformative exomic analyses (WES-negative) harbor de novo genetic and/or epigenetic mutations in critical regulatory elements that participate in developmental expression of cardiac genes. To identify these etiologies, we propose analyses of WGS in 1000 WES-negative CHD trios, prioritizing those with probands with banked CHD tissues (n=78), one damaging variant in a recessive CHD gene, and older fathers (age>45).

Mendelian cardiovascular disorders provide crucial insights into the genetic susceptibility to more common forms of cardiovascular disease. While Mendelian cardiovascular disorders are individually rare, collectively they impose a significant public health burden. This proposal focuses on 2 specific categories of cardiovascular disease for which we have extensive research expertise and existing cohorts, congenital heart disease (CHD) and inherited arrhythmia syndromes. The tremendous burden on the health care system and on families with these Mendelian cardiovascular disorders underscore the urgency to understand their genomic bases, in order to design improved strategies for risk stratification, surveillance and medical intervention. Emerging evidence supports the use of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) over whole-exome sequencing (WES) for detecting coding variants in discovery projects, in addition to the obvious advantages of detecting features invisible to WES: structural variants (SV) and non-coding variants. We believe the way forward lies in widening the scope for discovery to include the patient's entire genome - and all types of variants. While family-based studies are crucial for genomic discovery, obtaining a sufficient number of high-risk pedigrees to achieve meaningful conclusions remains a challenge for most research institutions. For this proposal, we will leverage 2 powerful resources for the identification, ascertainment and recruitment of high-risk cardiovascular disease pedigrees: (1) the NHLBI-sponsored Pediatric Cardiac Genomics Consortium (PCGC) and (2) the Utah Population Database (UPDB). We propose to perform WGS on PCGC and UPDB cohorts with autosomal dominant disease to achieve the following Specific Aims: Aim 1) Identify the genomic basis for CHD in high-risk pedigrees derived from the PCGC and UPDB; and Aim 2) Identify the genomic basis for inherited arrhythmia disorders, using extended pedigrees derived from the UPDB. Aim 2 focuses on familial forms of AF, undiagnosed Long QT Syndrome, Wolff-Parkinson White syndrome and progressive conduction disorders. A WGS approach in high-risk pedigrees coupled with our validated bioinformatics pipeline, will allow the identification and prioritization of disease-causing SVs and sequence variants in coding and non-coding regulatory elements. These variants will be functionally characterized and validated in downstream experiments (heterologous expression systems, zebrafish cardiac assays, induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes) that are beyond the scope of this X01. For this proposal, we have assembled the right combination of clinical expertise, resources for patient recruitment and computational know-how to enable these game-changing methodologies and to apply them to the challenge of cardiovascular Mendelian disease-gene discovery.

It is funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and is coordinated by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Molecular fingerprinting and extensive subject phenotyping will be performed to identify disease subpopulations and to identify and validate surrogate markers of disease severity, which will be useful as intermediate outcome measures for future clinical trials. Secondary aims are to clarify the natural history of COPD, to develop bioinformatic resources that will enable the utilization and sharing of data in studies of COPD and related diseases, and to create a collection of clinical, biomarker, radiographic, and genetic data that can be used by external investigators for other studies of COPD. Participating Institutions: Research participants for SPIROMICS will be enrolled, phenotyped, and followed at twelve SPIROMICS Clinical Centers: Columbia University, Temple University, Johns Hopkins University, Wake Forest University, University of Michigan, University of Illinois at Chicago, University of Iowa, University of Utah, National Jewish Health, University of California at San Francisco, and University of California at Los Angeles. The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill serves as the Genomics and Informatics Center. The Radiology Reading Center is based at the University of Iowa. The PFT Reading Center is based at the University of California at Los Angeles. Study Design: SPIROMICS is a prospective cohort study that enrolled approximately 2,981 participants at twelve clinical centers over five years. Participants are distributed across four enrollment strata (i.e., Never-smokers, Smokers without COPD, Mild/Moderate COPD, and Severe COPD). Study Visits: Participants have up to four in-person visits (Baseline and Annual Clinic Visits at years 1, 2, 3 after Baseline). Study questionnaires and spirometry are completed at all main study visits. Blood and urine samples are collected at visits 1, 2, and 4. Sputum samples are collected at Visit 1. The CT scans are completed and Baseline and Visit 2. Participants also receive quarterly follow-up calls to assess health status and determine if an exacerbation has occurred. Substudies  Bronchoscopy and Immunophenotyping Substudy The Bronchoscopy Substudy will enroll 50 subjects per site, for a total of 300 participants. These participants will be recruited across all four study strata. This substudy includes two study visits. During the first visit, sputum samples are collected for Immunophenotyping analysis at the Immunophenotyping Core Lab based at the University of Michigan. Participants then return for a second visit during which samples are collected via bronchoscopy, including bronchoalveolar lavage, epithelial brushings and bronchial biopsies. Immunophenotyping analysis is also conducted on BAL and blood collected during the bronchoscopy study visit. Repeatability Substudy The entire baseline clinic visit was repeated on 98 volunteers to determine reliability of measurement procedures. All baseline study-related procedures and questionnaires, including the CT scan, were re-administered and new samples of blood, urine, saliva, and sputum were collected. Field center staff processed these biospecimen samples according to the same protocol. Exacerbation Substudy The Exacerbation Substudy is a prospective, longitudinal observational study of up to 400 participants, which will allow the assessment of participant-driven health care utilization (HCU) events and symptom-defined exacerbation events over time. HCU-driven events are defined by change in medical treatment in response to a perceived COPD Exacerbation. Symptom-based events will be defined by using EXACT-PRO (EXacerbations of Chronic Pulmonary Disease Tool - Patient Reported Outcome), a daily symptom diary developed to measure the frequency, severity, and duration of exacerbations in clinical trials. All participants are provided with a PDA on which to complete the diary. Participants reporting a possible COPD exacerbation will be brought into the study clinic for a study visit to collect biological specimens and questionnaire data.  The overall objectives of the Exacerbation Substudy are to:  Obtain clinical data and specimens on SPIROMICS participants before and during an acute COPD exacerbation defined by  Health care utilization triggered by the subject, or Symptomatic change (triggered by an EXACT defined threshold)   Describe symptomatic changes occurring around HCU and symptom-defined (EXACT) events and their relationship to clinical and specimen data, Characterize the non-exacerbation ""stable"" state in COPD using the EXACT, including:  Symptom variability (EXACT), Clinical data and specimen parameters during a stable state (baseline), The relationship between clinical and specimen data and symptom severity and variability.   Explore the characteristics of stable patients, defined as those who do not experience HCU or symptom-defined (EXACT) events during the sub-study period, using baseline clinical data and specimens, and compare these characteristics with patients who experience HCU and/or symptom-defined events. Examine the relationship between HCU and symptom-defined exacerbation frequency during the first one-year period of follow-up for exacerbations and health outcomes, including 12-month change in lung function and COPD health status, and longer-term morbidity and mortality, with the latter derived from long-term data from the larger SPIROMICS study.

TOPMed will contribute to this initiative through the integration of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and other -omics (e.g., metabolic profiles, protein and RNA expression patterns) data with molecular, behavioral, imaging, environmental, and clinical data. In doing so, this program aims to uncover factors that increase or decrease the risk of disease, to identify subtypes of disease, and to develop more targeted and personalized treatments. Two genotype call sets derived from WGS are now available, Freeze 8 (GRCh38) and Freeze 9b (GRCh38), with largely overlapping sample sets.

It is funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and is coordinated by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Molecular fingerprinting and extensive subject phenotyping will be performed to identify disease subpopulations and to identify and validate surrogate markers of disease severity, which will be useful as intermediate outcome measures for future clinical trials. Secondary aims are to clarify the natural history of COPD, to develop bioinformatic resources that will enable the utilization and sharing of data in studies of COPD and related diseases, and to create a collection of clinical, biomarker, radiographic, and genetic data that can be used by external investigators for other studies of COPD. Participating Institutions: Research participants for SPIROMICS will be enrolled, phenotyped, and followed at twelve SPIROMICS Clinical Centers: Columbia University, Temple University, Johns Hopkins University, Wake Forest University, University of Michigan, University of Illinois at Chicago, University of Iowa, University of Utah, National Jewish Health, University of California at San Francisco, and University of California at Los Angeles. The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill serves as the Genomics and Informatics Center. The Radiology Reading Center is based at the University of Iowa. The PFT Reading Center is based at the University of California at Los Angeles. Study Design: SPIROMICS is a prospective cohort study that enrolled approximately 2,981 participants at twelve clinical centers over five years. Participants are distributed across four enrollment strata (i.e., Never-smokers, Smokers without COPD, Mild/Moderate COPD, and Severe COPD). Study Visits: Participants have up to four in-person visits (Baseline and Annual Clinic Visits at years 1, 2, 3 after Baseline). Study questionnaires and spirometry are completed at all main study visits. Blood and urine samples are collected at visits 1, 2, and 4. Sputum samples are collected at Visit 1. The CT scans are completed and Baseline and Visit 2. Participants also receive quarterly follow-up calls to assess health status and determine if an exacerbation has occurred. Substudies  Bronchoscopy and Immunophenotyping Substudy The Bronchoscopy Substudy will enroll 50 subjects per site, for a total of 300 participants. These participants will be recruited across all four study strata. This substudy includes two study visits. During the first visit, sputum samples are collected for Immunophenotyping analysis at the Immunophenotyping Core Lab based at the University of Michigan. Participants then return for a second visit during which samples are collected via bronchoscopy, including bronchoalveolar lavage, epithelial brushings and bronchial biopsies. Immunophenotyping analysis is also conducted on BAL and blood collected during the bronchoscopy study visit. Repeatability Substudy The entire baseline clinic visit was repeated on 98 volunteers to determine reliability of measurement procedures. All baseline study-related procedures and questionnaires, including the CT scan, were re-administered and new samples of blood, urine, saliva, and sputum were collected. Field center staff processed these biospecimen samples according to the same protocol. Exacerbation Substudy The Exacerbation Substudy is a prospective, longitudinal observational study of up to 400 participants, which will allow the assessment of participant-driven health care utilization (HCU) events and symptom-defined exacerbation events over time. HCU-driven events are defined by change in medical treatment in response to a perceived COPD Exacerbation. Symptom-based events will be defined by using EXACT-PRO (EXacerbations of Chronic Pulmonary Disease Tool - Patient Reported Outcome), a daily symptom diary developed to measure the frequency, severity, and duration of exacerbations in clinical trials. All participants are provided with a PDA on which to complete the diary. Participants reporting a possible COPD exacerbation will be brought into the study clinic for a study visit to collect biological specimens and questionnaire data.  The overall objectives of the Exacerbation Substudy are to:  Obtain clinical data and specimens on SPIROMICS participants before and during an acute COPD exacerbation defined by  Health care utilization triggered by the subject, or Symptomatic change (triggered by an EXACT defined threshold)   Describe symptomatic changes occurring around HCU and symptom-defined (EXACT) events and their relationship to clinical and specimen data, Characterize the non-exacerbation ""stable"" state in COPD using the EXACT, including:  Symptom variability (EXACT), Clinical data and specimen parameters during a stable state (baseline), The relationship between clinical and specimen data and symptom severity and variability.   Explore the characteristics of stable patients, defined as those who do not experience HCU or symptom-defined (EXACT) events during the sub-study period, using baseline clinical data and specimens, and compare these characteristics with patients who experience HCU and/or symptom-defined events. Examine the relationship between HCU and symptom-defined exacerbation frequency during the first one-year period of follow-up for exacerbations and health outcomes, including 12-month change in lung function and COPD health status, and longer-term morbidity and mortality, with the latter derived from long-term data from the larger SPIROMICS study.

It is a common complication of sickle cell disease and initially presents with the symptom of shortness of breath (dyspnea) on exertion. As the condition worsens, other symptoms such as dizziness, lower extremity edema, and chest pain can develop. The drug, sildenafil, works by relaxing blood vessels in the lungs which reduces pulmonary blood pressure and allows more oxygenated blood to circulate. Increased levels of oxygenated blood allows individuals with PAH to tolerate more activity, but guidelines for using sildenafil in patients with PAH and sickle cell disease were unavailable at the time of the Walk-PHaSST trial.Participants were screened for the existence of pulmonary hypertension with a six minute walk test and a Doppler echocardiogram that assessed TRV, diastolic function, and valvular and systolic function. Subjects with TRV ≥ 2.7 m/s received further clinical evaluation for possible causes of pulmonary hypertension. Other screening data included medical history, a physical exam, and standard laboratory testing. For individuals with moderate to severe pulmonary hypertension (TRV ≥ 3.0), a cardiac catheterization was done at the baseline and week 16 data collection periods.Subjects eligible for the main intervention trial based on screening results were randomized in a 1:1 double blind fashion to receive sildenafil or placebo for 16 weeks. Subjects received 20 mg of oral sildenafil or matching placebo 3 times daily for 6 weeks, followed by 40 mg 3 times daily for 4 weeks, followed by 80 mg 3 times daily for 6 weeks, as tolerated. Participants could also receive other therapies as needed to manage sickle cell and related complications. The primary outcome measure of the trial was change in the six minute walk test, a standard indicator of a person's heart and lung function and exercise capacity, from baseline to week 16. After completing the study treatment (or placebo), participants could choose to be part of the open-label follow-up phase of the study and continue to be assessed for up to one year.The study was intended to screen about 1000 subjects and randomize 132 subjects, however it was terminated early due to the unforeseen increase in adverse events in participants treated with sildenafil as compared to placebo. When the study was stopped, 33 participants had completed the trial. Subjects continued to be monitored, but were instructed to taper sildenafil treatment over three to seven days.There was no evidence that treatment with sildenafil impacted the six minute walk distance from baseline to week 16. In addition, treatment with sildenafil appeared to increase rates of hospitalization due to sickle cell disease pain.Due to in part to the early termination of the trial, the majority of subject data was collected from the screening phase of the study (n=720), as opposed to the main intervention trial (n=74).Instructions for requesting individual-level data are available on BioData Catalyst at https://biodatacatalyst.nhlbi.nih.gov/resources/data/.

The overarching goal of the registry is to study trends in transplantations and to advance the understanding and application of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation for malignant and non-malignant diseases. Included in this dataset are children, adolescents and young adults with severe sickle cell disease who received an allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant in the United States and provided written informed consent for research.Hematopoietic cell transplant for sickle cell disease is curative. Offering this treatment for patients with severe disease is challenging as only about 20-25% of patients expected to benefit have an HLA-matched sibling. Consequently, several transplantations have utilized an HLA-matched or mismatched unrelated adult donor and HLA-mismatched relative. Transplantation strategies have also evolved over time that has included transplant conditioning regimens of varying intensity, grafts other than bone marrow and novel approaches to overcome the donor-recipient histocompatibility barrier and limit graft-versus-host disease. The data that is available for sickle cell disease transplants have been utilized to report on outcomes after transplantation and compare outcomes after transplantation of grafts HLA-matched related, HLA-mismatched related, HLA-matched and HLA-mismatched unrelated donors. Collectively, these data have advanced our knowledge and understanding of hematopoietic cell transplant for this disease. These data can also serve as 'contemporaneous controls' for comparison with other more recent curative treatments like gene therapy and gene editing.Data available for request include allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplants for sickle cell disease (Hb SS and Hb Sβ thalassemia) in the United States from 1991 to 2019.

phs002386.v1.p1,c1,Optimizing Primary Stroke Prevention in Children with Sickle Cell Anemia (STOP II),BioLINCC,2024-05-09,"Name: STOPII_GRU, short name: STOPII.","The STOP II trial evaluated whether prophylactic transfusion in patients with sickle cell disease and high risk of stroke can be safely halted after 30 months of treatment during which patients became low risk for stroke.Stroke causes substantial morbidity in children with sickle cell disease. To prevent first strokes, the Stroke Prevention Trial in Sickle Cell Anemia (STOP) used prophylactic transfusions in children who were identified by transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasonography as being at high risk for stroke. This strategy reduced the incidence of stroke among such children from 10% per year to less than 1% per year, leading to recommendations for TCD screening and prophylactic transfusion for children with abnormal velocities on ultrasonography. Despite the reduced risk of stroke, long-term use of transfusions can cause adverse side effects, such as iron overload or alloimmunization. However, cessation of transfusions is associated with recurrence of stroke, and at the time of the STOP II trial, there were no clinical or laboratory indicators to guide the duration of prophylaxis. Therefore the STOP II trial was initiated to determine whether transfusions could be limited by monitoring patients with TCD examinations after transfusions were halted and resuming transfusions if the examination indicated a high risk of stroke.The trial was halted for safety concerns after 79 of a planned 100 children were randomized. Discontinuation of transfusion for the prevention of stroke in children with sickle cell disease resulted in a high rate of reversion to abnormal blood-flow velocities on Doppler studies and stroke incidence.Instructions for requesting individual-level data are available on BioData Catalyst at https://biodatacatalyst.nhlbi.nih.gov/resources/data/.

In 1995, the Multicenter Study of Hydroxyurea (MSH) (dbGaP phs002348) demonstrated that, in adults, hydroxyurea is effective in decreasing the frequency of painful crises, hospitalizations for crises, acute chest syndrome, and blood transfusions by 50%. The phase I/II study of hydroxyurea in children (HUG KIDS) demonstrated that children have a response to hydroxyurea similar to that seen in adults in terms of increasing fetal hemoglobin levels and total hemoglobin, and decreasing complications associated with sickle cell anemia. In addition, this study demonstrated that the drug does not adversely affect growth and development between the ages of 5 and 15. A pilot study of hydroxyurea (HUSOFT) given to children between the ages of 6 months and 24 months demonstrated that the drug was well tolerated and that the fetal hemoglobin levels rose and remained elevated compared to baseline with continued hydroxyurea administration.A Special Emphasis Panel (SEP) met on April 12, 1996 to review the results of the MSH trial and the progress to date of the HUG KIDS study. The SEP recommended that NHLBI undertake the BABY HUG trial.The BABY HUG Randomized Controlled Trial concluded that hydroxyurea treatment in very young children seemed to have an acceptable safety profile and to reduce complications of sickle cell anemia. However, more data were needed on the long-term safety of hydroxyurea use in very young children. As a result, follow-up studies were initiated. The Follow-Up Study II provided longer follow-up than Follow-Up Study I, and included more assessment types than Follow-Up Study I.The BABY HUG program consisted of three related studies, each of which has associated datasets and bio-specimens.A randomized controlled trial comparing hydroxyurea to placebo in very young children with sickle cell anemia (BABY HUG Randomized Controlled Trial)The first observational follow-up study of children from the randomized controlled trial (BABY HUG Follow-Up Study I).

The study began in 1990 with the initial aims of quantifying the familial aggregation of sleep apnea. National Institutes of Health (NIH) renewals provided expansion of the original cohort, including increased minority recruitment, and longitudinal follow-up, with the last exam occurring in February 2006. The CFS was designed to provide fundamental epidemiological data on risk factors for sleep disordered breathing (SDB). The sample was selected by identifying affected probands who had laboratory diagnosed obstructive sleep apnea. All first-degree relatives, spouses and available second-degree relatives of affected probands were studied. In addition, during the first 5 study years, neighborhood control families were identified through a neighborhood proband, and his/her spouses and first-degree relatives. Each exam, occurring at approximately 4-year intervals, included new enrollment as well as follow up exams for previously enrolled subjects. For the first three visits, data, including an overnight sleep study, were collected in participants' homes while the last visit occurred in a general clinical research center (GCRC). Phenotypic characterization of the entire cohort included overnight sleep apnea studies, blood pressure, spirometry, anthropometry and questionnaires. Currently, data of 710 individuals are available for use through BioData Catalyst (with genotype data available through dbGaP).The National Sleep Research Resource (NSRR) is a NIH-supported sleep data repository that offers free access to large collections of de-identified physiological signals and related clinical data from a large range of cohort studies, clinical trials and other data sources from children and adults, including healthy individuals from the community and individuals with known sleep or other health disorders.  The goals of NSRR are to facilitate rigorous research that requires access to large or more diverse data sets, including raw physiological signals, to promote a better understanding of risk factors for sleep and circadian disorders and/or the impact of sleep disturbances on health-related outcomes.  Data from over 15 data sources and more than 40,000 individual sleep studies, many linked to dozens if not hundreds of clinical data elements, are available (as of Feb. 2022).

Heavily transfused patients frequently develop human leukocyte antigen (HLA) allo-immunization resulting in platelet transfusion refractoriness and a high risk for life-threatening thrombocytopenia. Data suggest complement activation leading to the destruction of platelets bound by HLA allo-antibodies may play a pathophysiologic role in platelet refractoriness. We conducted a pilot trial to investigate the use of eculizumab to treat platelet transfusion refractoriness in allo-immunized patients with severe thrombocytopenia. We hypothesized that when we treated patients having platelet refractoriness with eculizumab, platelet counts would increase to higher numbers after platelet transfusions, decreasing the risk of bleeding complications associated with having a low platelet count. The response of the treatment was assessed by the corrected platelet count increment (CCI) 10 - 60 min and 18 - 24 h post transfusion, and any requirement for subsequent platelet transfusions following eculizumab.

Psoriasis is a systemic inflammatory disease associated with poor high-density lipoprotein function and accelerated non-calcified burden by coronary computed tomographic angiography. In this study, 310 psoriasis patients from The Psoriasis, Atherosclerosis, and Cardiometabolic Disease Initiative (PACI) were studied at baseline to determine if levels of circulating apolipoprotein A-1 predict early onset coronary artery disease in inflammatory conditions. Of the 310 participants, 124 were followed for four years to determine if apolipoprotein A-1 predicts non-calcified coronary burden over time. The primary outcome of this study was non-calcified coronary burden by coronary computed tomography angiography. To assess non-calcified coronary burden, participants underwent coronary computed tomography angiography using the same scanner (320-detector row Aquilion ONE ViSION, Toshiba, Japan). For ApoA-1 quantification, fasting blood draw was performed the same day as the coronary computed tomography angiography. The 400MHz proton Vantera Clinical Analyzer was used to quantify Plasma apolipoprotein A-1. The study determined that low levels of apolipoprotein A-1 are associated with increased coronary artery burden and that this relationship persists over time.

Enrolled patients with and without known SARS-CoV-2 infection will be observed for clinical signs and symptoms of PASC and will be assessed for risk and resiliency factors and potential mediating factors associated with the severity and progression of PASC. The objective of the RECOVER initiative is to enhance knowledge of recovery from SARS-CoV-2 infections in order to support development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic interventions. Overarching scientific objectives are as follows: Characterize the incidence and prevalence of sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Characterize the spectrum of clinical symptoms, subclinical organ dysfunction, natural history, and distinct phenotypes identified as sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection.Define the biological mechanisms underlying pathogenesis of the sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The RECOVER observational studies comprise three cohorts across the lifespan (adult, pediatric, and tissue pathology (autopsy)). The data collection and data analysis plans for each cohort have been harmonized to use common data elements where feasible. Brief descriptions of each cohort are provided in the following paragraphs:1) NIH RECOVER: A Multi-site Observational Study of Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Adults The RECOVER adult cohort study is a combined retrospective and prospective, longitudinal, observational meta-cohort of individuals who will enter the cohort with and without SARS-CoV-2 infection and at varying stages before and after infection. Individuals with and without SARS-CoV-2 infection and with or without PASC symptoms will be followed to identify risk factors and occurrence of PASC. This study will be conducted in the United States and subjects will be recruited through inpatient, outpatient, and community-based settings. Study data including age, demographics, social determinants of health, medical history, vaccination history, details of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, overall health and physical function, and PASC symptom screen will be reported by subjects or collected from the electronic health record using a case report form at specified intervals. Biologic specimens will be collected at specified intervals, with some tests performed in local clinical laboratories and others performed by centralized research centers or banked in the Biospecimen Repository. Advanced clinical examinations and radiologic examinations will be performed at local study sites with cross-site standardization. 2) The RECOVER Post Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC) Pediatric Cohort Study: A Multi-Center Observational StudyThe RECOVER pediatric study is a combined retrospective and prospective, longitudinal, observational meta-cohort of individuals ages newborn-25 years who will enter the cohort with and without SARS-CoV-2 infection at varying stages before and after infection. Individuals with and without SARS-CoV-2 infection and with or without PASC symptoms will be followed to identify risk factors and occurrence of PASC. This study recruit participants inpatient, outpatient, and community-based settings in the United States. Study data including age, demographics, social determinants of health, medical history, vaccination history, details of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, overall health and physical function, and PASC symptoms will be reported by participants or collected from the electronic health record using a case report form at specified intervals. Biologic specimens will be collected at specified intervals, with some tests performed in local clinical laboratories and others performed by centralized research centers or banked in the Biospecimen Repository. Advanced clinical and radiologic examinations will be performed at local study sites with cross-site standardization.3) NIH RECOVER: A Multi-site Pathology Study of Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 Infection The RECOVER tissue pathology study is a cross-sectional study designed to define and characterize the epidemiology, natural history, clinical spectrum, and underlying mechanisms of post-acute effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a diverse population representative of the general COVID-19 population in the US. The autopsy study will characterize the pathology of PASC in (i) non-hospitalized patients who die 30 days or later from symptom onset of COVID-19, and (ii) hospitalized patients who die 30 days or later after discharge from a hospitalization for COVID-19. The study will include decedents who had previously fully recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection (i.e., >30 days from onset in non-hospitalized, or >30 days from discharge in hospitalized patients), and decedents who meet clinical criteria of PASC as defined by the recent World Health Organization publication (see Section 5.4 below). The autopsy study will also explore the pathology of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection in a smaller subset of patients who died 15-30 days from symptom onset. This protocol defines the common set of clinical data elements, autopsy procedures for tissue collection, core measures, pathology protocols, shared pathology tissues, data elements, and methodology. Each investigator site is expected to perform autopsies on the decedents to address the pathophysiology of the potential long-term effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on human health. The Consortium analysis plan aims to address research questions by incorporating: 1) tissue obtained from autopsies performed at each Phase II participant's site; and 2) tissue available from other pathology investigators/autopsy sites within the Consortium.

Children with sickle cell disease experience organ damage, impaired quality of life, and premature mortality. A blood stem cell transplant is a treatment option for someone with a severe form of the disease. Prior to undergoing a transplant, people typically receive a conditioning regimen of high doses of chemotherapy and other medications to prepare the body to accept the transplant. This type of conditioning regimen is known as a myeloablative conditioning regimen, but it can result in toxicities and sterility. A conditioning regimen that uses lower doses of chemotherapy and medications may be safer for transplant recipients. This type of regimen is known as reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimen. RIC has a more favorable toxicity profile but is associated with higher rates of graft rejection (GR), especially with graft sources such as umbilical cord blood This study evaluated the safety and effectiveness of blood stem cell transplants, using bone marrow from unrelated donors, in children with severe SCD who receive a RIC regimen prior to the transplant.SubjectsPatients 3.0-19.75 years old with symptomatic SCD AND one or more of the following complications: (1)-(i) a clinically significant neurologic event (stroke) or any neurologic defect lasting > 24 hours and accompanied by an infarct on cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); OR, (ii) patients who have a Transcranial Doppler (TCD) velocity that exceeds 200 cm/sec by the non-imaging technique (or TCD measurement of >185 cm/sec by the imaging technique) measured at a minimum of 2 separate occasions one month or more apart; OR, (2) Minimum of two episodes of acute chest syndrome within the preceding 2-year period defined as new pulmonary alveolar consolidation involving at least one complete lung segment (associated with acute symptoms including fever, chest pain, tachypnea, wheezing, rales, or cough that is not attributed to asthma or bronchiolitis) despite adequate supportive care measures; OR, (3) History of 3 or more severe pain events (defined as new onset of pain that lasts for at least 2 hours for which there is no other explanation) per year in the 2 years prior to enrollment despite adequate supportive care measures (if patients are receiving hydroxyurea and compliant with therapy, being symptomatic is an indication for transplantation; however, if patients decline hydroxyurea or non-compliant with this therapy, they would still remain eligible for study if pain criteria as described above are met). Lansky/Karnofsky performance score must be ≥ 40. Hemoglobin S must be ≤ 45%. Patients must have an unrelated adult bone marrow donor who is HLA-matched at 8 of 8 HLA-A, -B, -C and -DRB1 at high resolution using DNA-based typing. Patients with bridging fibrosis or cirrhosis of the liver, with uncontrolled bacterial, viral, or fungal infection in the past month, or seropositivity for HIV are excluded. Patients with HLA-matched family donors, or who have received prior HCT, and females who are pregnant or breast feeding are excluded. Thirty patients were enrolled on this study and of these, 29 patients met the criteria and proceeded to the study transplant.DesignParticipants attended a study visit prior to the transplant to undergo a blood collection, neurocognitive testing to measure learning and brain function, magnetic resonance angiogram (MRA) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Questionnaires to assess quality of life were also completed. All patients received erythrocyte transfusions before transplant. Twenty-two days (-22) before the transplant, participants began receiving a reduced intensity conditioning regimen of chemotherapy and medications. On days -21, -20, and -19 participants weighing 10 kg or more received 10 mg, 15 mg, and then 20 mg of Alemtuzumab intravenously (IV) followed by 30 mg/m2/day IV on days -8 through -4 of Fludarabine. Eight days (-8) before the transplant, participants were admitted to the hospital to continue the conditioning regimen which included 140 mg/m2 IV of Melphalan on day -3. Participants received the bone marrow transplant on day 0. Prophylaxis for GVHD consisted of a calcineurin inhibitor (tacrolimus or cyclosporine) administered from day -3 through day 100 after graft infusion, with subsequent taper through day 180; methotrexate 7.5 mg/m2 on days 1, 3, and 6; and methylprednisolone 1 mg/kg per day from days 7 through 28, with subsequent taper by 20% per week. One week after the transplant continuing until the WBC is normal, participants received granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). After leaving the hospital, participants attended study visits weekly during weeks 1 to 8, at day 60, weekly during weeks 9 to 14, at Day 100, at month 6, and at years 1 and 2. At all study visits, a blood collection, medical history review, and physical exam occurred. In addition, at day 100, month 6, and years 1 and 2, questionnaires to assess quality of life were completed. At select visits the following procedures were conducted: lung function testing, heart function testing, MRA and MRI scans, and neurocognitive testing.The primary outcome was 1-year EFS. Death, disease recurrence or graft rejection by 1 year were considered events for this endpoint.ConclusionsThe trial met its prespecified 1-year EFS, and significantly improved HRQL was reported posttransplant. However, although the Reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) provided successful engraftment in most patients, the regimen cannot be considered safe for widespread adoption without modification due to the regimen-related toxicity (RRT) and high rate of chronic GVHD, which was the predominant cause of mortality.

Intravenous loop diuretics are an essential component of current treatment and are administered to approximately 90% of patients who are hospitalized with heart failure. Despite decades of clinical experience with these agents, prospective data to guide the use of loop diuretics are sparse, and current guidelines are based primarily on expert opinion. As a result, clinical practice varies widely with regard to both the mode of administration and the dosing.SubjectsA total of 308 patients were enrolled between March 2008 and November 2009 at 26 clinical sites in the United States and Canada. DesignThe DOSE study was a prospective, randomized, double-blind, controlled trial with a 2-by-2 factorial design. Patients were randomly assigned to either a low-dose strategy (total intravenous furosemide dose equal to their total daily oral loop diuretic dose in furosemide equivalents) or a high-dose strategy (total daily intravenous furosemide dose 2.5 times their total daily oral loop diuretic dose in furosemide equivalents) and to administration of furosemide either by intravenous bolus every 12 hours or by continuous intravenous infusion.The study treatment, with group assignments concealed, was continued for up to 72 hours. At 48 hours, the treating physician had the option of adjusting the diuretic strategy on the basis of the clinical response. An assessment of biomarkers, including creatinine, cystatin C, and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide, was performed at a central core laboratory at baseline, 72 hours, and 60 days. Patients were followed for clinical events to day 60. The coprimary end points were patients' global assessment of symptoms, quantified as the area under the curve (AUC) of the score on a visual-analogue scale over the course of 72 hours, and the change in the serum creatinine level from baseline to 72 hours.ConclusionsAmong patients with acute decompensated heart failure, there were no significant differences in patients' global assessment of symptoms or in the change in renal function when diuretic therapy was administered by bolus as compared with continuous infusion or at a high dose as compared with a low dose.

Heart failure is characterized by an imbalance between left ventricular (LV) performance and myocardial energy consumption. There is a growing body of evidence that suggests oxidative stress contributes to ventricular and vascular remodeling, and disease progression in heart failure. Targeting potential source(s) of oxidative stress, e.g. Xanthine oxidase (XO), was the focus of recent clinical trials and epidemiological studies. Increased XO activity has been shown to lead to production of superoxide and uric acid (UA). Serum uric acid levels are included in heart failure risk scores, and hyperuricemia is present in about 25% of patients with heart failure. Hyperuricemia is associated with exercise intolerance, reduced survival, and worsening symptoms. The EXACT-HF trial tested allopurinol, an inhibitor of XO, as a potential target therapy for hyperuricemic heart failure patients.Subjects253 subjects were enrolled in the EXACT-HF study. 128 participants were randomized to the allopurinol arm, and of those participants, 119 completed the trial and 9 did not. 125 participants were randomized to the placebo arm, and of those participants, 116 completed the trial and 9 did not.DesignEXACT-HF was a multi-center, double-blind, placebo controlled, 24-week trial of allopurinol. Eligible participants had to be receiving a stable regimen for at least two weeks (3 months for beta-blockers) prior to randomization. Participants were randomized by an automated system to either the allopurinol or placebo arm, and started treatment within 12 hours of completing the baseline visit. During the first week, participants in both treatment arms received 300mg daily of the respective medications. For the following 23 weeks, participants in both treatment arms received 600mg daily of the respective medications. Patients unable to tolerate 600 mg were maintained on 300 mg.The primary endpoint was a composite clinical endpoint (CCE) that classified a subject's clinical status as improved, worsened, or unchanged at 24 weeks. The CCE was determined based on the following: death; hospitalization, emergency room visit or emergent clinic visit for worsening HF; medication change for worsening HF; and Patient Global Assessment using a 7-point scale. Secondary endpoints at 12 and 24 weeks included changes in quality of life as assessed by the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire, and submaximal exercise capacity as assessed by a 6-minute walk test.ConclusionsParticipants who received allopurinol had significantly less serum uric acid laboratory levels after 24 weeks; however, no significant difference was observed in the primary and secondary endpoints between the allopurinol and placebo-treated patients. Therefore, in high-risk HF patients with reduced ejection fraction and elevated uric acid levels, xanthine oxidase inhibition with allopurinol failed to improve clinical status, exercise capacity, quality of life, or LVEF at 24 weeks (Circulation. 2015 May 19; 131(20):1763-71).
